<time>02 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>With an</span><a href=#> <span>Emmy</span></a><span> win for his work on</span><a href=#> <i><span>The Big Bang Theory</span></i></a><span>, among countless other nominations,</span><a href=#> <b>Bob Newhart</b></a><span> has accomplished so much during his career. The beloved comedian is just as successful when it comes to his family, having raised four wonderful kids — Robert, Timothy, Jennifer and Courtney — alongside his wife, <a href=#>Ginnie Newhart</a>, before her death in April 2023. </span><b>Scroll below for more details on their children.&nbsp;</b></p><h2><b>Who Are Bob Newhart’s Kids?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Bob and Ginnie’s decades-long romance dates back to 1962 when they were set up on a blind date by Buddy Hackett.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“[Buddy said], ‘I’ve got a girl for you. She’s going with another guy, but I don’t think he’s right for her, so I’m going to fix you up on a blind date,'” the former</span><i><span> Bob Newhart Show</span></i><span> star told</span><a href=#> <i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in 2019. “‘You’ll meet her, and you’ll date, and you’ll get married. Then you’ll have kids, and you’ll call one of the kids, Buddy.'”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny02.jpg><p><span>It seems the late comedian was really trying to make something happen between the two considering Ginnie revealed Buddy also approached her about going out with Bob.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Buddy came back one day and said in his own inimitable way, ‘I met this young guy, and his name is Bobby Newhart, and he’s a comic and he’s Catholic and you’re Catholic,’” she told</span><a href=#> <i><span>City & Shore Magazine</span></i></a><span> in 2013. “‘I think maybe you should marry each other.’”</span></p><p><span>It’s almost as if Buddy was spot on, as the lovebirds</span><a href=#> <span>tied the knot</span></a><span> not long after they started dating in 1963. Later that year in November, Bob and Ginnie welcomed their first child, son Robert. The couple’s second child, Timothy, arrived in 1966, followed by daughter Jennifer in 1970. The duo completed their family when their youngest child, Courtney, was born in December 1977.</span></p><p><span>Throughout the years he was raising his kids, Bob juggled his work on </span><i><span>Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Bob Newhart Show</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Newhart</span></i><span> and more. While his children stayed out of the spotlight for the most part, they’ve joined their dad at a few red carpet events over the years, including the Mark Twain Prize for Humor Award ceremony in 2002. Bob and his kids also stepped out at the 3rd Annual TV Land Awards in 2005.</span></p><p><span>Though they didn’t pave Hollywood careers like their dad, Bob’s older sons and younger daughter, Courtney, tried their hand at Hollywood at one point. As IMDb states, Robert</span><a href=#> <span>has one acting credit</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Heart and Souls</span></i><span> in 1993, while Timothy</span><a href=#> <span>worked throughout the early ’90s</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>Get a Life</span></i><span>,</span><a href=#> <i><span>Ferris Bueller</span></i></a><span> and </span><i><span>Newhart</span></i><span>. Courtney, on the other hand, once appeared as an actress in </span><i><span>Newhart</span></i><span> in 1986, and she also</span><a href=#> <span>earned credit</span></a><span> as a production assistant on </span><i><span>George & Leo</span></i><span> in 1997.</span></p><p><span>Bob and Ginnie were married for 60 years up until her death at age 82 in April 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Ginnie Newhart, 82, beloved wife of 60 years to comedy legend Bob Newhart, passed away Sunday, April 23, after a long illness,” publicist </span><b>Jerry Digney</b><span> confirmed in a statement to</span><i><span> People</span></i><span> at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Does Bob Newhart Have Grandkids?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Bob is relishing his role as a grandpa to his number of grandchildren. According to reports, the</span><a href=#> <span>Golden Globe</span></a><span> winner has at least 10 grandkids through his wonderful children. Speaking with </span><i><span>Closer</span></i><span> in August 2019,</span><a href=#> <span>Bob gave a glimpse inside his life as a grandparent</span></a><span> and revealed some advice he gave his grandson about following in his footsteps.</span></p><p><span>“My grandson did stand-up the other day. I asked him what it was like. He said he told one joke and it worked, then he told another that didn’t work, but he went right ahead,” Bob shared. “I said, ‘That’s the secret. You’ve got to keep going and put one foot in front of the other.'”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bpptlnprEqa3Rrapmo5mZwG65xJ6rZpuYnrmlvsSnZJqmlGKzornIpbBmr5mptW7DyJ%2BcZp%2BZo7u6ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbob-newharts-kids-meet-children-and-family-with-wife-ginny.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./country-bluegrass-and-flour.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./country-bluegrass-and-flour.html>Country, Bluegrass, and Flour Chris Coyier</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-facts-about-west-bromwich-albion.html>15 Facts About West Bromwich Albion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-facts-about-west-bromwich-albion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

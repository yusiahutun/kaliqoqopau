If there is ever a time when a consensus is reached on this issue, Jana Kramer is the perfect figurehead for it. It certainly takes more than a coincidence to be married three times and all marriages last on average 9 months.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bio</strong></h2><p>Jana Kramer, born on December 2, 1983, is a country musician and actress who has seamlessly and successfully combined both careers. Jana was born in Rochester Hills, Michigan. Her parents were Nora and Martin Kramer. Together with her brother Steve, she attended Rochester Adams High School.</p><p>Her breakthrough came in the series One Tree Hill, which was broadcast from 2009 to 2012, in which she played the role of Alex Dupree. In 2012 she also began her country music career with a single release called Why Ya Wanna.</p><p>After taking a break from the line-up of One Tree Hill to invest more time in her music, Jana received a record deal with Elektra Records in February 2011. She immediately set about recording her promo track “I Won’t Give Up”. The title was used as the soundtrack in the One Tree Hill episode “Holding Out for a Hero” and reached number 75 on the US Billboard Hot 100 Charts.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Is Mitch Grassi Married? Here Is Everything We Know About His Gay Partner</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jana Kramer Husband</strong></h2><p>Not many people at the age of 34 can boast of having been married to three different men and also of having locked and broken off an engagement. At the young age of 19, Jana Kramer, a beautiful, attractive rising star in the film industry, married Michael Gambino in Las Vegas in 2004 in a so-called whirlwind wedding.</p><p>Jana Kramer turned out to be a victim of domestic violence as Gambino allegedly attacked her. In an exclusive interview with “Good Morning America,” Kramer spoke about the night she was almost murdered by her first husband. She told how often he came home late at night, “either loaded with pills or drugs” and on that fateful night picked her up from her bed, threw her to the floor, and threatened to kill her.</p><p>She told how she prayed, how her life flashed before her eyes while he choked her, and all this happened after she tried to leave the house. She says she still suffers from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) as a result of the time she spent with Michael Gambino.</p><p>He was eventually convicted of premeditated murder and later served five years in prison to be paroled. Kramer said she was scared when she learned of his release and was later reassured when she heard that Gambino had committed suicide. Their marriage began in 2004 and ended the same year after a few months.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Nicole Petallides: Family and Facts About TD Ameritrade Network’s Anchor</a></strong></p><p>Kramer became engaged to actor Johnathon Schaech on December 22, 2009, and they were married on July 4, 2010. The marriage did not last very long, as they filed for divorce, which was executed in June 2011. The marriage lasted 11 months.</p><p>Jana Kramer started dating Brantley Gilbert, a country singer, and they got engaged in January 2013, but in August of the same year, they separated again.</p><p>In May 2015 she married former NFL tight-end Michael Caussin for the third time, and together the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter – Jolie Rae. In August 2017, she announced that she would be separating from her husband for alleged infidelity both before and after her marriage.</p><p>Michael apologized to Jana, she accepted his apology and went to therapy for sex addiction. Jana and Michael mended the fences and in December 2017 announced through their Instagram handle that they renewed their marriage vows on a private trip to Hawaii.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height, Feet, Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Jana Kramer stands at a height of 5 ft 4 inches and her body weighs 53 kg.

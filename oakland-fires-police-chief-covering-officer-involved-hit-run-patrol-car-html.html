He will continue to have my respect and appreciation,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She further noted her admiration for the many Oakland police officers who work 'extremely hard' and serve the public with integrity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In January, Armstrong was placed on paid administrative leave as the mayor reviewed investigations by the federal monitor assigned to the department, which ultimately found Armstrong responsible for a 'gross dereliction of duty.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said he was incredibly disappointed in the decision to fire him and that once all the facts are evaluated, it will be clear he committed no misconduct</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'After the relevant facts are fully evaluated by weighing evidence instead of pulling soundbites from strategically leaked, inaccurate reports, it will be clear I was a loyal and effective reformer of the Oakland Police Department,' read a statement from Armstrong's representative Sam Singer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It will be&nbsp;equally clear that I committed no misconduct, and my termination is fundamentally wrong, unjustified, and unfair.

revealed that Armstrong failed to appropriately investigate and discipline Chung after he hit a Mercedes Benz parked next to him while exiting the parking garage of his San Francisco building.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The report found that Officer Kayla Brandwood was with Chung during the incident nearly two years ago - on March 25, 2021.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Though Chung stopped his patrol car for roughly five seconds, neither law enforcement officer stepped out of the vehicle despite surveillance footage from the parking garage showing that impact from the collision 'ripped' the front bumper off the luxury vehicle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The crash was not subsequently reported to supervisors, nor was the city made aware of the incident until it received a claim from Progressive Insurance detailing what had happened.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the 56-page report from the law firm of Clarence Dyer and Cohen said a police captain in the department's Internal Affairs Division undermined the severity of the incident and coached the investigating officer to draft a report allowing Chung to escape serious discipline.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One year later, Chung fired his gun inside an elevator at Oakland Police headquarters and hid the evidence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He did not inform his supervisors until a week after the incident and has reportedly been on paid leave ever since.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Armstrong was the 13th person to lead the ailing department since the federal oversight began in 2003.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was backed by John Burris, one of two attorneys who filed the initial lawsuit against the department back in 2000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even after his dismissal, Burris is standing by Armstrong and said he was disappointed in Thao's decision based on what he believes is 'not very strong evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Armstrong.'</p><img id=i-81db40a230f7e723 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/16/18/67768825-11759713-image-a-5_1676573215865.jpg height=445 width=634 alt="The Oakland

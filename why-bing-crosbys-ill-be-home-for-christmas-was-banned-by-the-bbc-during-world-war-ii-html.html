For people of all ages, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>these songs are legendary</a> and are a necessary part of holiday celebrations. One of these fan-favorite <a href=#>Christmas</a> songs is one that has been around for decades, surviving trends and defying all the odds. “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” is a holiday staple, a soothing song that evokes memories of nostalgia in everyone who hears it. As sung by the legendary singer Bing Crosby, “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” is one of the most performed holiday songs of the century, a tune that was originally written to provide some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>hope and comfort to soldiers</a> in the dark days of World War II.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bing-Crosby.jpg><h2>Bing Crosby is an iconic singer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_73>Long before he crooned “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” Bing Crosby had made a name for himself as a singer and actor. Crosby was born in 1903 and developed his singing career very early. By the early 1920s, Crosby was singing with various bands, touring the United States to try to make a name for himself, according to <a href=#>Biography</a>. After working hard for nearly a decade, Crosby made his radio debut in 1931.</p><p id=par-3_76>By the mid-thirties, Crosby was not only a popular singer, but he had started to break into films, as well. In short order, Crosby appeared in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dozens of movies</a>, including Road to Singapore, Holiday Inn, The Bells of St. Mary’s, Going My Way, and White Christmas. As popular as Crosby’s films were, however, he made the most lasting impact on pop culture with his music — and especially the 1943 track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.”</p><h2>Who wrote ‘I’ll Be Home for Christmas’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_87>The song was written by Kim Gannon and Walter Kent and is told from the perspective of a soldier serving overseas during World War II. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Vintage News</a>, the song features the soldier asking his family back home for all the things that make a cozy holiday season — snow, mistletoe, presents under the tree, and family. Initially, Gannon and Kent had a hard time marketing the song, because many people felt as though the subject was too sad and depressing for a Christmas song.</p><p id=par-5_73>Still, when Gannon approached Bing Crosby on the golf course (Crosby was a notorious fan of golf) and sang part of the song to him, Crosby agreed to record the tune. In October 1943, Crosby recorded the song — and it quickly became a hit, especially with soldiers stationed overseas. Crosby went on many USO tours in the years that followed, and one of his most-requested songs was “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.”&nbsp;</p><h2>‘I’ll Be Home for Christmas’ was banned by the BBC</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_71>As much as United States troops loved “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” there were a few who didn’t think that the song was up to snuff. In fact, as reported by Vintage News, the BBC actually banned the song because they thought that it would lower morale among British troops. In spite of that, the song became a worldwide sensation, breaking records and uniting fans of all religions, ages, and interests.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_69>These days, “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” remains a holiday classic. It has been recorded by a variety of famous artists, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba McEntire</a>, Pentatonix, Brian McKnight, Sara Evans, Elvis Presley, Kelly Clarkson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Groban</a>, and many more. Still, for many fans, the Bing Crosby version remains the undisputed king of Christmas songs, a tune that remains as relevant and heartfelt as the day that it was first released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqcWMm6Cnn12Yv7C%2FwbKqZqGcoXqjsYyhpqadXZu8s3nCoamiq6SirrR51pqqZpqRo7umsIybsGasmJp6o67CZpuuqpmjtG7DzqujnWWnlr9utchnn62lnGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-bing-crosbys-ill-be-home-for-christmas-was-banned-by-the-bbc-during-world-war-ii-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-bing-crosbys-ill-be-home-for-christmas-was-banned-by-the-bbc-during-world-war-ii-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-bing-crosbys-ill-be-home-for-christmas-was-banned-by-the-bbc-during-world-war-ii-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-bing-crosbys-ill-be-home-for-christmas-was-banned-by-the-bbc-during-world-war-ii-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-bing-crosbys-ill-be-home-for-christmas-was-banned-by-the-bbc-during-world-war-ii-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-bing-crosbys-ill-be-home-for-christmas-was-banned-by-the-bbc-during-world-war-ii-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-cheated-husband-female-friend-eat-pray-love-author-left-marriage-woman-drives-happily-married-wife-question-sexuality-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-cheated-husband-female-friend-eat-pray-love-author-left-marriage-woman-drives-happily-married-wife-question-sexuality-html.html>Why I cheated on my husband with a female friend: After Eat Pray Love author left her marriage for a</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./anita-blanche.html>Who is Anita Blanche dating?

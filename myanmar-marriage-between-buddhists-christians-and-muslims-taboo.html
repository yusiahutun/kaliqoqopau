In addition to advocating for Buddhists to boycott Muslim shops, one of the movement’s key platforms was opposing Buddhist women marrying Muslim men.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite fears of Muslim expansion, Muslims make up only a small segment of Myanmar’s population. The 2014 census identified just over 1 million Muslims in the country, comprising some 2 per cent of its population, while an estimated 90 per cent of the country’s 51 million people were Buddhist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These numbers, however, do not include the roughly 1 million Rohingya Muslims who at the time resided in Rakhine State; most have since fled to Bangladesh following mass atrocities committed by the military in 2016 and 2017. A United Nations investigation of the 2017 violence found it occurred with “genocidal intent”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/22/e9d3f5f8-d556-11e9-a556-d14d94601503_1320x770_154331.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Negative perceptions of “other races”, and Muslims in particular, are also instilled in the Buddhist-majority country through schools and institutions. From 2010 to last year, the fifth-grade civics education curriculum contained a poem which said children had the responsibility to “maintain the dignity of one’s own race” and avoid having one’s race “swallowed by another”. It included the line: “We hate mixed blood, it will make a race extinct.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The motto of the Myanmar government’s Ministry of Immigration and Population, as stated on its website, is “The earth will not swallow a race to extinction but another race will.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong class="bolddin11 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>‘WE DON’T WANT YOUR SON TO BE A MUSLIM’</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Khine understood these perceptions; she once subscribed to them. “I used to hate Muslims a lot,” she said. As a teenager, she and her friends would read Burmese-language books. “We didn’t know the source … [the books said] Muslims are very bad, [that] they want to take control of the world; they will marry Buddhist women and make them deliver many babies,” she recalled reading.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Khine once visited a friend’s home to convince his parents to make him break up with his Muslim girlfriend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At university, she unknowingly befriended a Muslim classmate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a little shift,” Khine said. “The first step of change in my life.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Radical monk Wirathu, known as ‘Buddhist Bin Laden’, faces arrest in Myanmar</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She met Min when providing relief for Cyclone Nargis in 2008, and they began dating a few months later. She said she first tried to push Min’s religious background to the back of her mind. When they finally talked about religion, more than a year into the relationship, Khine realised she and Min shared a similar world view.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple dated secretly. When Khine’s colleague found out, she tried to break up the relationship, as Khine had once done to her friend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Laws pertaining to marriage between those of different faiths vary throughout Southeast Asia. In Singapore and Malaysia, marriages involving Muslims are categorised separately from civil marriages, and are subject to their own customary rules. Indonesia’s constitution permits people to marry who they choose, but many civil servants refuse to conduct interfaith marriages, citing ambiguities in the legal wording.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/22/848ddafe-cf9f-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_154331.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, the monk-led ultranationalist group Ma Ba Tha – an abbreviation for the Association for the Protection of Race and Religion – successfully advocated for the passing of four “Protection of Race and Religion” laws in Myanmar. According to one – the Buddhist Women Special Marriage Law – before a Buddhist woman can marry a non-Buddhist man, the couple must go through an administrative process, including the public posting of a marriage application and allowing the community to submit objections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Khine and Min married before this law was passed; however, in order to get married in court under civil law, both needed to be Buddhist. In December 2011, Min signed a certificate acknowledging a willing conversion to Buddhism, and the couple married five months later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite Min’s on-paper conversion, the couple continue to maintain separate religions. They celebrate Buddhist full-moon days as well as Muslim Eid, and when Khine travels, Min puts flowers on the Buddhist shrine in their home.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Abandoned in Assam: India creates its own Rohingya, and calls them ‘Bangladeshi’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When they had their son in 2013, they hired a Christian carer so he would not be more exposed to one parent’s religion than the other. “We tell him, ‘You can decide’,” Khine said. “But if he says this in front of my family members … they will contact me immediately and say, ‘You need to watch out. We don’t want your son to be a Muslim’.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Khine and her son applied for their passports in June, they needed to wait in separate lines – “national races” for Khine, and “mixed blood” for her son, the latter a designation for Burmese Muslims and those of South Asian and Chinese descent. Khine’s passport was issued immediately, but she was informed that her son would have to undergo security clearance, including a home interview, which, two months later, had not occurred.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/22/fe0de84e-d556-11e9-a556-d14d94601503_1320x770_154331.JPG><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong class="bolddin11 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>‘YOU DON’T HAVE PEOPLE LEFT TO MARRY?’</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Muslim men marrying Buddhist women in Myanmar face unique institutional challenges and social exclusion, Christian women and their Muslim partners interviewed by <span class="italics_allfonts css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0><span class="italics_allfonts css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>This Week</span> in Asia</span> also reported facing difficulties in their families and society. Julie, 26, and Rocky, 27, became friends in middle school in downtown Yangon. They dated secretly for eight years before eloping in 2014. Because of their different religions – Julie is Christian and Rocky is Muslim – some of their relatives still refuse to talk to them.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">People [in Myanmar] think that if the guy is Muslim, [the girl’s] life will be hellRocky</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Julie’s friends found out about the relationship, some tried to convince her to break up with Rocky. “People [in Myanmar] think that if the guy is Muslim, [the girl’s] life will be hell,” Rocky said. “They think that Muslims are terrorists … that [Muslim] religion, race, little by little can control the power.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Buddhist women must go through an administrative process to marry men of other religions, if both partners are non-Buddhist, their marriage falls under customary practices. Julie and Rocky’s marriage was presided over by an imam; Julie was not required to convert to Islam.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Rohingya Muslims need citizenship and basic rights from Myanmar and Asean should make it happen, experts say</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After marrying, they rented a flat in Yangon’s suburbs, where neighbours regularly harassed them. “When people saw that a Muslim had married a Christian, they popped our tyres, broke our wipers, licence plates, mirrors,” Rocky said. “It happened often … We never went out. We never even opened the window … we were really scared.” Their doorbell rang frequently, he said, but when they opened the door, no one was there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Daily interactions with strangers can still be uncomfortable. “[People] don’t like us,” Rocky said. “Some people ask [Julie], ‘Why are you married to him? You don’t have people left to marry?’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Min and Khine, the couple maintain their separate religions. “I am flexible. She is flexible. The main thing is that we understand each other,” Rocky said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple, who run a shop in downtown Yangon, have decided not to have children. “Their blood will be mixed,” Rocky said. “We don’t want them to suffer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/22/0170a3fc-dd0c-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_1320x770_154331.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong class="bolddin11 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>‘THEY RAISED SERIOUS OBJECTIONS’</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ravina, a 23-year-old Christian, and Zide, a 20-year-old Muslim, met through a shared interest in street dance and began dating about a year ago. Ravina, who works in a salon, and Zide, a transcriber in an office, hold hands in public and are open with Zide’s family and friends, but not Ravina’s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Everybody in my social environment will gossip,” Ravina said, adding that within her community, “it is really bad that he is Muslim”. When a few of her friends found out, they raised serious objections, she said. “They are afraid I will change my religion.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the couple goes on dates, Ravina said people looked at them from head to toe and some laughed at them. Zide said their peers were generally more accepting than older generations, but “there is always someone who will try to find a problem … They gossip, look at us like it is their job”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zide goes to the mosque every Friday; Ravina to church every Sunday. They have agreed that if they marry, “she will believe what she believes and I will believe what I believe”, Zide said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the office where Khine works as a trainer on interfaith dialogue, colleagues and trainees asked her whether it was true that she married a Muslim. “They might stop talking to me or attending my training … After they know I am married to a Muslim, they change.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She hopes that, in the face of an often seemingly bleak situation, person-to-person connections will slowly bring change. “We need to have interactions first to really understand each other,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rocky also emphasised the importance of the individual. “If we want to change the country, we have to change the people’s mindset first … We have to change ourselves.” <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGppamdmgXR7zLKYp6WRp3qurdGroJqflWKvpsDWnpynZZKqsaW0yKyrrGWTnb%2Bqv9OimKerXZa7pXnMrqqloZ2oerWtwaim</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmyanmar-marriage-between-buddhists-christians-and-muslims-taboo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmyanmar-marriage-between-buddhists-christians-and-muslims-taboo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmyanmar-marriage-between-buddhists-christians-and-muslims-taboo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmyanmar-marriage-between-buddhists-christians-and-muslims-taboo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmyanmar-marriage-between-buddhists-christians-and-muslims-taboo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmyanmar-marriage-between-buddhists-christians-and-muslims-taboo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robot-wars-philippa-forresters-baffles-22019829.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robot-wars-philippa-forresters-baffles-22019829.html>Robot Wars' Philippa Forrester's baffles This Morning viewers with 'new accent'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-use-skincare-acids.html>Exfoliating acids in skincare explained</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-use-skincare-acids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Somehow, the bra looked virtually undetectable underneath the tight tank — no lines, straps, or bumps peeked through. Everything looked smooth and rounded.

While we already know Chantelle works wonders for the gals, we took it upon ourselves to specifically put these T-shirt bras to the test, trying almost all the options the brand offers to see if they worked just as well on our chests as they did for Larson — or if it was just cinematic magic that blessed her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Across the board, one thing stood out to us all the most: the top lining of every single one of Chantelle’s T-shirt bras sat flat against the chest, never revealing any lining from underneath the shirt. We never had to worry about any gaping, which is a key element to a good T-shirt bra.

For Senior Commerce Editor Chloe Anello, finding a T-shirt bra on her 32DD chest is a hassle, to say the least. “As someone with a larger chest, I care a lot about support, more so than appearance. I've had back problems before because I have relatively heavy breasts, and this bra felt the most supportive.” The cups are like perfect pockets for breasts, fully covering the upper chest, thus maximizing support. If you want to recreate Brie Larson's look to the T with perfectly rounded breasts, then we definitely recommend this one because Anello happened to have a nearly identical top, and this bra looked invisible underneath it. Thanks to the hooks in the back, she was able to connect the straps to each other and have them completely hidden. After 24 hours of wear, they never dug or felt uncomfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But we felt this bra was less successful on smaller cup sizes. Commerce writer Bianca Kratky has to agree on the comfort the bra provides. However, on her 34B chest, they felt like a bit too much fabric and support that she needed. Although they cupped her chest perfectly, lying flat against the chest and looking invisible under a T-shirt, the sheer amount of fabric made them poke out from underneath a low-cut tank top. For this reason, it’s probably not the ideal bra for slinky tops. But we think you’ll be impressed with the fit and appearance underneath crew neck T-shirts and high-neck tanks, especially if you have larger breasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $78</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Larger chests <strong>| Sizes: </strong>34B–40H <strong>|</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>4<strong> | Materials: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Chloe Anello / Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-racerback-chantelle-c-jolie-custom-fit-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Racerback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle C Jolie Custom Fit T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle C Jolie Custom Fit T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Je7DlbgAkMmUJfg9nkew7NefeDk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chantelle--c-jolie-custom-fit-t-shirt-bra-c55ed98ae9614c908f6233812a37b48e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>For a medium coverage bra, this option provides tons of support.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The hooks are difficult to clasp from the back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For Senior Commerce Editor Shannon Bauer, this bra exceeded expectations and became her most worn bra. For Anello? Not so much. The difference between the two however was a matter of preference. Those that love full-coverage bras should resort to option one on this list because this bra gives 3/4 coverage, which typically works better for those in the B to C cup range and adore that second-skin feel. Bauer, who tried on a 34C, says that this “has become my go-to bra for the work day because the straps sit nicely on my shoulders, the cups fit well and are invisible under all tops I have tried, and it has support without being too structured.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Much like the previous option, this one comes with hooks to combine the straps together in the back as well. You can even adjust the location of the hook, pushing them up or down on the straps. Although Anello found the racerback to lift her breasts up uncomfortably in this form — and she thought the outline of the straps looked a bit too clear on the back — Bauer still thought it felt plenty comfortable on her smaller chest. She does warn, however, that it’s difficult to hook the racerback design behind your back. She recommends hooking it off your body, then pulling it over your head. Once it’s clipped on, you never have to worry about it accidentally popping off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $78</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Midsize chest<strong> | Sizes: </strong>32B–36G <strong>|</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>7<strong> | Materials: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Shannon Bauer</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-medium-coverage-chantelle-norah-chic-ecolight-flex-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Medium Coverage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Norah Chic EcoLight Flex T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle Norah Chic EcoLight Flex T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/or4C1tsRMJA44-8MLAQEzEjLODg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/norah-chic-ecolight-flex-t-shirt-bra--6d36135c03e3412dba1fd0eda165b77e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s very supportive on heavy breasts.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s difficult to hide the straps under a tank top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found something perfect for top-heavy, full breasts, and it’s this Norah Chic EcoLight Flex T-Shirt. The cups are much more rounded out and provide adequate medium coverage. Women with apple-shaped breasts will love how the cups pocket each boob in a supportive and uplifting manner (without a push up). “I liked how it looked under V-neck T-shirts the best because it lifted everything in a way that a V-neck tee needs,” says Anello. While the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Comfort Chic Full Coverage Custom Fit Bra</a> pokes out from underneath a low cut, this one stays hidden underneath the shirt.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bauer also found that the underwire was very supportive and strong; she thinks they would be ideal for women with heavy chests, like Anello says she has. The thicker back band that seamlessly leads into the straps also provide additional support, taking some of the weight off your back. This does make it a little more difficult to hide under skimpier dresses and tanks. You also can’t create a racerback with the straps like with the previous two options. This is truly more for T-shirts, rather than tank tops (unless you have thick strap tanks like Bauer).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $84</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Round, heavy breasts<strong> | Sizes: </strong>34B–38G<strong> |</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Materials: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Chloe Anello</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-chantelle-basic-invisible-smooth-custom-fit-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Basic Invisible Smooth Custom Fit Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle Basic Invisible Smooth Custom Fit Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fa7ixojIkduv3OzPX4Ss701WvHM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/basic-invisible-smooth-custom-fit-bra-af45112d7baa41e89e2fb9bb06ed01d9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re comfortable, full coverage, and don’t show under shirts, hitting a bra-trifecta.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>For wider set chests, the bridge between the cups may dig a little.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now here’s a great full-coverage bra, for smaller breasts. For Commerce Editor Mary Honkus, who considers herself “less blessed in the chest”, this bra was the favorite out of all the ones she tried from Chantelle. “It was very comfortable. I liked wearing it and didn’t think about it while wearing it,” she says, which is why we awarded it the best everyday piece. Bauer echoes her sentiment, adding that “for full coverage, I was impressed how seamless this looked even under low scoop and v-neck tees.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cups go up to the upper curve of the breasts and don’t create any gaping. There’s a U-shaped back, which is more tank-top-friendly than the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Norah Chic</a> option we just discussed. Although, it still doesn’t have any clasps to hook the back straps together. Honkus also noticed that the bra dug in ever-so-slightly towards the middle of her chest, due to her having <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wider set breasts</a>. It never caused any pain throughout the day, however.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $57</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Small to mid sized chest<strong> | Sizes: </strong>32B–34G<strong> |</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Materials: </strong>Polyamide, polyester, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Mary Honkus</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-low-cuts-chantelle-bare-essential-custom-fit-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Low-cuts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Bare Essential Custom Fit T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle Bare Essential Custom Fit T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1NwxbAHbD0De0PH8l2iz9LZbhzw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bare-essential-custom-fit-t-shirt-bra-c1cc20dc2fc141c3ba979e5aaf28f808.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The almost balconette-style bra perfectly hides underneath a low-cut tank top.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You can’t clip the straps together to create a racerback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t be fooled by the seemingly large cups on this bra when you first pull it out of its packaging, as Senior Commerce Editor Kaitlin Clark was. While the mid-to-full coverage bra looked like it would be too much on her 36B chest, once on, she was very surprised to find it miraculously fit perfectly. The astonishments didn’t end there, however. When she pulled a low-cut tank top over it, the cups blended in seamlessly, going full-on camouflage. The bra takes a little inspiration from balconette bras, which notably scoop the breasts up, giving them a more lifted look. Because of the cut, you never have to worry about the top half poking out from under the shirt.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the shape of the cups, we noticed the straps aren’t parallel to each other, which impacted the fit. They sit closer together in the back, going outwards toward your shoulder, almost in a V-shape. This allows the straps to hide in the back. “After I put my tank on, I had to actively look for the straps, thinking I must have gotten them tangled. But no!” exclaimed Clark. The way the straps are sewn together also helped to give her chest a gentle lift that looked natural. You can’t, however, clip them together to create a racerback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bra doesn’t disappoint in the support department either. “I have implants, so I need a sturdy bra, and this one was nice; I didn't feel achy at the end of the day. It had just the right level of support for me,” says Clark. The material is thick and substantial, adequately covering the nipple as well. That didn’t stop it from being airy, however, as Clark found them to be quite comfortable even through some sweat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $74</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Mid to large chests<strong> | Sizes: </strong>32B–36F <strong>|</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Materials: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Kaitlin Clark</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-smaller-chests-chantelle-lucie-lace-comfort-smooth-custom-fit-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Smaller Chests</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Lucie Lace Comfort Smooth Custom Fit Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle Lucie Lace Comfort Smooth Custom Fit Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TkaRaP7p4jS32zLG-RBHBb32jV0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lucie-lace-comfort-smooth-custom-fit-demi-t-shirt-bra--397937999da34be8a54636309321ae23.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The mid coverage and the lace makes this one of the more sexier options.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It makes your chest look a little flat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of all the bras she tested from Chantelle, this one was Kratky’s favorite. Maybe because the smaller cups appealed to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>small (but proud) chest </a>more. She gravitated towards this one the most initially and continued to enjoy wearing it as the day progressed. Thanks to the double-lined band — with the skin-side featuring a very soft mesh band and the second layer showcasing a lace band — it felt stretchy and never dug into her sides.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many of the bras she tested had fantastic support and comfort, Kratky felt that they lacked cuteness, which is an important quality for her. But the Lucie Lace bra, however, stood out for its appearance because once she put it on, she thought it looked equal parts sexy and supportive. Similar to the Bare Essential T-Shirt bra we just talked about, this one comes with a mid-coverage and lower-cut cups, making it ideal for low-cut tank tops. You can’t spot any gaping or lines from under the shirt, and you’re left with a smooth silhouette (despite the lace). The cup laid flat against the chest, which is ideal as a T-shirt bra because it looked smooth underneath garments, but that also caused our (already small) chests to look a bit flat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $84</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Small chests<strong> | Sizes: </strong>32B–36G<strong> |</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Materials: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lace-chantelle-day-to-night-smooth-custom-fit-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lace</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Day to Night Smooth Custom Fit Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle Day to Night Smooth Custom Fit Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jb76_3h_AGk3CRpDNkJuHtHShjo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/day-to-night-smooth-custom-fit-bra-2a5c7a36ce4f4997b4ed0587b0097419.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The cups feel very smooth and soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The straps are not as stretchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s what we loved about this bra: the cups are buttery soft and felt angelic on the skin. Even for Kratky, who doesn’t necessarily love full-coverage bras on her small chest, found them to be just right. Clark also echoes that “it felt really soft against my body and I liked the way it looked. It felt supportive but still flexible.” It’s full coverage, but not nearly as full as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Comfort Chic Full Coverage Custom Fit Bra</a>, which was impossible to hide under a low-cut tank top. This one remained concealed for both Kratky and Clark.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What we didn’t love, however, was how the texture of the lace showed from underneath white tank tops. Not just the lace but the copper Chantelle button on the side, Clark found out. Kratky also felt that while the cups were soft and comfortable, the straps were less so. Finding the right strap length felt a bit awkward, as too short would cause them to slide down the arm but too tight and they began to dig into the skin. And because you can’t create a racerback with them, they tend to poke out from under tank tops as well. We recommend this one mainly for T-shirts that are a little looser because you won’t see the lines underneath; however, it will still give a rounded, lifted appearance every woman wants under her tees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $66</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>All <strong>| Sizes: </strong>34B–34G<strong> |</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Materials: </strong>Polyamide, elastane</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Kaitlin Clark</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before we began to test, we researched the highest-rated T-shirt bras offered by Chantelle. We then picked which bras we thought we would enjoy most, equally splitting up the best-sellers between our five person team whose sizes range from 34B to 32DD. The bras, which were all kindly sent to us by the Chantelle team, were worn by multiple team members of different cup sizes to get a more well-rounded idea of how they perform on each chest. Once we adequately tested each, we wrote our honest and unbiased reviews, evaluating details like fit, comfort, lift, appearance under T-shirts, and details, like if the straps could hook into a racerback style. Only the bras we loved made it into this article.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What To Keep In Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Coverage</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">T-shirt bras typically range between medium and full coverage, in order to avoid the gaping between the chest and the bra. If you are hoping to wear a low cut or V-neck shirt, opt for the medium coverage bras, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Norah Chic EcoLight Flex T-Shirt Bra</a> or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lucie Lace Comfort Smooth Custom Fit Bra</a>. However, if you’re hoping to recreate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Brie Larson’s Marvel look</a>, with a high-neck racerback tank, then opt for a full-coverage bra like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Comfort Chic Full Coverage Custom Fit Bra</a>. Not only is this one full coverage, but also you can convert the straps into a racerback, making it the best bra for such tank tops. For the sake of this story, the team at InStyle exclusively tested Chantelle’s T-shirt bras, but the brand also has a large catalog of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">demi-bras</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">plunge bras</a>, should you want something with less coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Strap Convertibility</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We paid close attention to whether or not we could convert the straps into racerbacks for this story. Those that can have a little hook and eye closure that can be clasped in order to hide the straps from showing. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Comfort Chic Full Coverage Custom Fit Bra</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">C Jolie Custom Fit T-Shirt Bra</a> are the only two that allow you to do this from this list. We did find that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bare Essential Custom Fit T-Shirt Bra</a>, while not convertible, has straps that are closer together in the back, creating a bit of a V-shape and making them easier to hide under tank tops as well.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Support</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, what’s a bra without support? The number one deed of a bra is to uphold and carry the weight of the girls through the day. The Chantelle bras did not disappoint in this matter, all functioning as perfect pockets for our breasts. We looked not only at the cups, but the band and the straps as well. Chantelle bras are all very well structured, with caging around the sides and thick bands to hold the body. While it might feel like a lot of fabric (especially the full coverage <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Comfort Chic</a> bra), it serves its purpose in supporting the chest and its surrounding areas.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is a T-shirt bra?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A T-shirt bra is a bra you can wear underneath a fitted shirt, and doesn’t cause any linings or straps to show. This means that the cups need to sit flat against the chest, so that it can look near-invisible underneath a form-fitting shirt.

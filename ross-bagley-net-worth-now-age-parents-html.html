One of them is Ross Bagley.&nbsp;</p><p>Ross began his acting career at the age of six with a supporting role in the comedy film ‘The Little Rascals.’&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A talent manager first set his eyes on Ross Bagley during a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> choir performance</a> at the First A.M.E Church in L.A. Bagley, a child virtuoso, did not know the date, but soon his choir performance became the gateway to acknowledge him as the renowned child actor.</p><p>Find More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Sophina Brown's Supportive Husband- All about Her Married Life</a></p><p>Bagley’s role as 'Nicky Banks' on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" dragged the international attention, and not before long his career started to gear up. He portrayed ‘Nicky Banks’ role perfectly at the age of six.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>With his amazing performance, Ross earned two Young Artist Awards at a very early age for his role as Nicky, one for Best Performance by an Actor Under Ten in a TV series and the other for Best Performance by an actor under Ten in Television.</p><p>His continuous successful roles took him to the extra height of his career. Then, in a little while, he got an excellent opportunity to work with the famous American actor Will Smith on the film "Independence Day."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Caption - Ross Bagley with Will Smith in the film "Independence Day." (Photo Credit -&nbsp;www.providr.com)</strong></p><p>By the end of 90’s he had a few significant projects like “Babe,” “The Wild,” and “Providence.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, acting might be the first stone where he earned his early major success, but it is probably not the only one for Ross.</p><p>Know About:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Angell Conwell Is Not Leaving Show Biz Anytime Soon !</a></p><p>He did continue acting, but he occasionally took on roles in projects like 'Judging Amy,’ and 'Gnome Alone’ before he retired from the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where Is Ross Bagley Now?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>In the interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hip Hop News Uncensored</a>, Ross shared that acting wasn’t appealing to him as a career. As he joined the showbiz at a young age, he always wanted to have a normal life and a normal job. He said:</p><p>"I wanted to live more of a normal type of life. I remember at the height of 'Fresh Prince,' I would be getting chased out of malls. I live a relatively under-the-radar life and that's how I am."</p><p>He left show business to pursue a college education at California State University, Northridge, where he also completed an internship with Will Smith's production firm, Westbrook Entertainment.</p><p>In 2015, Ross <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed </a>on her Instagram that he had discovered a new passion to chase, entirely far away from the cameras and the lights. He is a passionate real estate agent now in Los Angeles. Not only that, but as he grew older, he continued to enjoy DJing as a hobby, earning the stage name DJ Rossy B. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Ross Bagley Advertising His Dj Page on his Instagram. (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong></p><p>After revealing his profession, he also said that he has a son.</p><h2>Ross Bagley’s Son</h2><p>Ross Bagley, age 33, who was everyone's favorite child actor when he was younger, is no longer a youngster. In addition, he is a father to his son. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Rachel McAdams and Jennifer Garner's Uncanny Resemblance! Are They Related?</a></p><p>Following his profession, he revealed that he had a son&nbsp;named Reece. In August 2014, he announced the news by uploading a photo of his baby and calling him Baby Reece. However, Recce’s mother’s identity remains unknown. But, Ross appears to be quite close to his kid, as seen by his social media posts in which he shares pictures of them spending family time.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ross and his son getting ready. (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-630 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Because Ross began his career in show business at an early age, there is no indication that he would encourage his kid to follow in his footsteps. However, he understands the difficulties of breaking into the entertainment industry at a young age, and he may want his child&nbsp;to grow up in a normal environment.</p><p>Nonetheless, the real estate agent and child actor from the 1990s, who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has</a> a net worth of $500 thousand, now has a family of his own and is working hard to establish his new profession as a real estate agent.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p>We hope he'll share more pictures of his adorable kid on social media.

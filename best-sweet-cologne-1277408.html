This is the time to break down gender stereotypes and embrace fragrances that appeal to your personality — sweet, gentle, warm, comforting, and inviting scents can be masculine as well. So, we have picked the best sweet colognes for men that can help you dive headlong into the gorgeous explosion for the senses that sweeter scents can offer.&nbsp;</p><p>There are 3 main sweet scent categories to explore — fruity fragrances like <a href=#>Demeter Sweet Orange</a> offer refreshing, light notes with natural sweetness. We're talking oranges, juicy cherries, and other tantalizing fruits.&nbsp;</p><p>Floral scents use blooms like jasmine and rose to craft a sweet, romantic vibe. A standout sweet floral cologne for men for us is <a href=#>4711 Jasmine</a>, with its sensual fragrance..&nbsp;</p><p>Gourmand colognes like <a href=#>Cremo Spice & Black Vanilla</a> smell good enough to eat as they whip up scrumptious scents with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and more.</p><p>There’s more on our list along with full reviews, so read on to find a sweet-smelling cologne that works for you the best!</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>10 Best Sweet Colognes for Men That Are Addictive</h2></p><p>The bold, woody fragrance of Ralph Lauren Polo Black opens with a burst of juicy iced mango and cool silver armoise for a refreshing tropical twist. Heart notes of patchouli noir and sandalwood offer an alluring, sensual core while a musky base note lingers temptingly on the skin. The sweetness of this mysterious fragrance is not overpowering and instead, creates a subtle seductive effect on the skin.&nbsp;</p><p>For an Eau de toilette, we found this to be very long-lasting — while the top notes vanish, the base becomes a skin scent and lasts for the longer part of the day. We recommend this for men who want a bright fragrance that’s masculine and sophisticated with a hint of gentleness.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Notes: </strong>Mango, Mandarin, Cardamom, Jasmine, Silver, Ozone, Moss, Patchouli, Cedarwood</p><p><strong>Scent: </strong>Tropical, Sweet, Woody</p><p><strong>Concentration:</strong> Eau de Toilette</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>4.2 Fl Oz</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Refreshing, warm, and masculine fragrance</li><li>Affordable price point</li><li>TSA-compliant bottle size</li><li>Good projection</li><li>Good longevity</li><li>Fairly good sillage</li><li>Can be suitable for both genders</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=-0.73015873015873><p>2</p><p>Best Intimate Scent</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title=" 4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","B07XTRNJ46","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1277408","2024-02-09 15:13:57","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-sweet-cologne-1277408","Select","Beauty","B07XTRNJ46"," 4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne","2","Product Title")' readability=2><p><h3>4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title=" 4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","B07XTRNJ46","-")'><img alt=" 4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne" title=" 4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1277408","2024-02-09 15:13:57","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-sweet-cologne-1277408","Select","Beauty","B07XTRNJ46"," 4711 Jasmine Eau de Cologne","2","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ndL+AM1tL._SL500_.jpg></a></li><p>It may seem strange to have a jasmine fragrance listed amongst the best sweet colognes for men, but trust us when we say that you need this on your radar!

What impressed us most is that it’s not a synthetic orange fragrance — the scent is exactly like that of an orange freshly picked off a tree. And there’s a good reason for that; it’s made with natural essential oils, so just a spritz is enough to conjure up visions of peeling a juicy navel orange on a sunny winter morning.</p><p>We like how the crispy and tangy top notes of this cologne do not overshadow its balanced sweetness and depth. Although the scent profile is suitable for both men and women, we recommend this to any man looking for a fresh, energizing, sweet cologne that hits all the right notes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Notes: </strong>Orange Peel</p><p><strong>Scent: </strong>Citrus and Sweet</p><p><strong>Concentration</strong>: Eau de Cologne</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>1 Fl.

How a perfume lasts comes down to one thing — concentration. The higher the concentration, the longer that captivating aroma lingers.</p><ul><li>Eau de Parfum is the power player, with 15-25% fragrance concentration. Just one spray envelops you in that exquisite scent for a full 8-10 hours.&nbsp;</li><li>For everyday allure, go for Eau de Toilette. With 8-15% fragrance concentration, it caresses your senses for 6-8 hours. It’s subtle, yet makes an impression. Mist it over your clothes and on your warm spots for a softer but sensuous scent.</li><li>When you need a quick pick-me-up, keep Eau de Cologne in your bag. At just 2-7% concentration, it lasts around 2 hours, giving you a fresh boost whenever you need it. Spritz as needed to revive your senses all day long.</li></ul><p>So choose your concentration wisely. Whether you want to leave a lasting impression or just a fleeting flirtation, there's a fragrance concentration for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scent Family And Key Notes</strong></p><p>Most sweet perfumes belong to floral, woody, or oriental scent families. Occasionally, fruity notes from the fresh fragrance family make their way to sweet perfumes. You can pick from either, depending on what kind of notes resonate more with you.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Floral perfumes are most commonly sweet — think roses, peonies, jasmine, lily. Depending on the blends, they can be light and delicate or intense and complex. We like <a href=#><u>Jo Malone English Pear & Freesia Cologne Spray</u></a> in this fragrance family.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=#><u>Oriental fragrances</u></a> can be sweet, warm, and even spicy and usually offer a more complex and luxurious olfactory experience. Think cardamon, vanilla, amber, or patchouli blended with florals and woods. <a href=#><u>18.21 Man Made Absolute Mahogany</u></a> is not typically oriental and has more woody undertones, but offers a similar experience.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=#><u>Woody perfumes</u></a> can be dry or wet; while the dry woody scents lean towards being smoky, the moss-like earthy notes in some woody perfumes can result in a fragrant sweetness with depth.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Sometimes, perfumers create unique and heavenly overlaps. By looking at the kind of fragrance families and perfume notes you lean towards, you can pick the perfect sweet cologne for yourself.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>When it comes to finding the best sweet colognes for men, it is wise to not restrict yourself to families that you may tend to think are more “masculine”. For instance, florals are typically categorized as feminine scents, but you may be pleasantly surprised that floral notes like lily of the valley, orange blossoms, rose, and jasmine feature in men’s colognes quite commonly. <a href=#><u>Ralph Lauren Polo Black</u></a> contains heart notes of jasmine and can be considered one of the most popular sweet-smelling colognes for men — we certainly dig it. The point is, don’t be afraid to dive deep and find the perfect sweet match for yourself. Ladies will love it, we bet.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Are sweet colognes suitable for all occasions?</p><p>Sweet colognes are suitable for all occasions; however, it is wise to pick depending on the overall scent profile and intensity of sweetness. For instance, candy or bubblegum scents may not suit formal occasions whereas floral or woody sweet may be apt for it.</p><p>Do sweet colognes last long on the skin?</p><p>How long a cologne will last on the skin depends mostly on its perfume concentration and moisturization levels of the skin. Eau de perfumes usually last longer than Eau de toilettes, which typically last longer than Eau de colognes.</p><p>Are there specific sweet colognes for men and women, or can they be unisex?</p><p>Most sweet colognes are unisex, such as Demeter’s Sweet Orange Pick Me Up Cologne Spray and Jo Malone English Pear & Freesia Cologne Spray. However, there are also gender-specific sweet colognes, such as Aromi Handsome Solid Cologne for men.</p><p>Are there sweet colognes that offer a fresh or citrusy twist?</p><p>Sweet colognes are usually from floral, woody, and oriental families. However, there are some very well-balanced citrusy and fresh sweet colognes out there as well, such as Demeter Sweet Orange Pick Me Up Cologne Spray and King of Love Eau de Toilette.</p><p>What is the best sweet smell?</p><p>The best sweet smell is subjective; However notes of vanilla in sweet perfumes is very popular and great for men who want to venture into sweet colognes.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Sayantani, our in-house beauty and makeup expert, has a great nose for perfumes and a passion to keep experimenting with different fragrances.

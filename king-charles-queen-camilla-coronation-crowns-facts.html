The Royal Collection Trust notes that the original is thought to be dated back to the eleventh-century royal saint, Edward the Confessor, who was the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">St Edward's Crown was commissioned from the crown jeweler, Robert Vyner, in 1661. Vyner did not perfectly replicate the original headpiece, though he imitated the original design by including four crosses-pattée, four fleurs-de-lis, and two arches. The crown additionally includes a deep purple velvet cap, an ermine band, an orb and cross topper, a solid gold frame, and plenty of gems such as rubies, amethysts, sapphires, garnet, topazes, and tourmalines.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Imperial State Crown</h2><img alt="london, england november 6 the imperial state crown is brought to the house of lords for the state opening of parliament on november 6, 2007 in london, england photo by tim graham photo library via getty images" title="State Opening of Parliament" width=3276 height=2184 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-77732160-64417a92c9950.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tim Graham Royal Photos</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Imperial State Crown</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the coronation service, the king will exchange St Edward's Crown for the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rct.uk/collection/31701/the-imperial-state-crown data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Imperial State Crown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Imperial State Crown</a>, which he will likely wear during the Coronation Procession and while waving to members of the public on the Buckingham Palace balcony.

He later gave it to his son, Prince James Francis Edward, who then passed it to his son, Henry Benedict, Cardinal York. Henry is said to have later sold the sapphire to King George IV, and thus returned the stone to the British royal family's collection.</li><li>Cullinan II, also known as the Second Star of Africa, is the second-largest stone cut from the Cullinan Diamond, the largest rough diamond ever found. The diamond was mined in South Africa in 1905, and subsequently forced over to the British royal family. In the decades since, the Cullinan II and its sister stones have sparked calls for the royal family to return the diamonds to South Africa as more and more people criticize their role in plundering colonized lands.</li></ul><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What Queen Camilla Will Wear</strong></h2><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Queen Mary's Crown</h2><img alt="the state crown of queen mary" title="The State Crown Of Queen Mary" width=880 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vintage-illustration-of-the-state-crown-of-queen-mary-news-photo-1682016968.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">GraphicaArtis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Queen Mary's Crown</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Camilla will be crowned with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rct.uk/collection/31704/queen-marys-crown data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Mary's Crown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Queen Mary's Crown</a>.

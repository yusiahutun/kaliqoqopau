Here’s all to know about Reed Paul Jobs.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Reed Paul Jobs was born into fame and wealth as the only son of late billionaire Steve Jobs. But despite his background, he prefers to keep a very low profile.&nbsp;Here’s what we know about his life, background, and career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Reed_Paul_Jobs></span>Who Is Reed Paul Jobs?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reed Paul Jobs was born to parents Steve Jobs and Lauren Powell in Palo Alto, California, on September 22, 1991. He grew up alongside his two younger siblings. His father named him “Reed” after Reed College, an Oregon-based school he attended in his youth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Reed-jobs.jpg><p>However, Steve dropped out after just one semester to pursue his tech career. This has made people wonder why it was significant enough to name his first son after the school.&nbsp;</p><p>Reed attended the prestigious Menlo School and Crystal Springs Uplands School early on. For his university education, he attended Stanford University for his undergraduate oncology degree and graduated in 2014. It is widely reported that Reed took an interest in medicine and oncology, particularly because of his father’s battle with cancer, which eventually cost him his life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/steve-and-reed-1024x702.jpg><p>The following year, Reed graduated with an Oncology master’s degree. During his time at Stanford University, he was involved in several extracurricular activities, and many say he showed great passion for social issues.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reed_Paul_Jobs_Career></span>Reed Paul Jobs’ Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After graduating from one of the world’s most prestigious universities, Reed joined Emerson Collective, a social impact organization founded by his mother, Laurene Powell Jobs. There, he works as the organization’s health director.</p><p>Reed is particularly interested in cancer research due to his father’s death and has been involved in various projects to find a cure. He has also supported organizations such as Stand Up To Cancer and the Cancer Research Institute and does much philanthropic work worldwide.</p><p>Reed also focuses on initiatives related to education, immigration reform, and environmental conservation. In 2017, the celebrity kid invested in a desktop and mobile app called “Montage.” The app allows users to create collaborative video surprises on special occasions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Reed_Paul_Jobs_Parents></span>Who Are Reed Paul Jobs’ Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reed is a full-on celebrity kid, as his inherited fame comes from his father and mother.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steve_Jobs></span>Steve Jobs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>During his lifetime, Reed’s father, <a href=#>Steve Jobs</a>, was one of the world’s most popular and influential people. He was most commonly known as the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc., one of the top tech brands in the world.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/136696579_1735893436570115_630977747398489395_n.jpg><p>Steve was a very successful business mogul owning multi-billion dollar companies. Some of these include his positions as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar</li><li>Member of The Walt Disney Company’s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar</li><li>Pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak</li><li>Founder, Chairman, and CEO of NeXT.</li></ul><p>As expected, Steve’s innovations and accomplishments made him very wealthy. He was given a lot of accolades and significant awards during his lifetime and posthumously. A few of those awards include:</p><ul><li>1985: National Medal of Technology (with Steve Wozniak) by US President Ronald Reagan, the country’s highest honor for technological achievements,</li><li>1989: Entrepreneur of the Decade by Inc.,</li><li>2004–2010: Listed among the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World on five separate occasions,</li><li>2007: Named the most powerful person in business by Fortune magazine</li><li>2013: Posthumously inducted as a Disney Legend&nbsp;</li><li>2017: Steve Jobs Theater opens at Apple Park</li><li>2022: Posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President Joe Biden, the country’s highest civilian honor</li></ul><p>In October 2003, Steve was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which he announced to his employees in mid-2004. He battled this disease until his death on October 5, 2011.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Laurene_Powell_Jobs></span>Laurene Powell Jobs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Reed’s mother, <a href=#>Laurene</a>, is an American billionaire businesswoman and executive. She is Emerson Collective and XQ Institute’s founder and chair and manages the “Steve Jobs Trust,” her late husband’s Trust fund.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Laurene.jpg><p>Her organization, <a href=#>Emerson Collective</a>, is involved in various fields such as Education, Immigration Reform, Journalism, Health, Media, and the Environment. It invests in high-potential companies and firms in these fields and so far has several firms in its investment portfolio.</p><p>These include Ozy, an entertainment and media company, The Atlantic, Axios Media which is a website that curates content on business, politics, and technology, Gimlet Media, and Pop-Up Magazine.</p><p>Laurene is also very actively involved in politics. She is a significant fundraiser backing politicians like America’s current president, Joe Biden, and his Vice, Kamala Harris.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Reed_Paul_Jobs_an_Only_Child></span>Is Reed Paul Jobs an Only Child?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Reed is not the only child of his parents. His mother, Laurene, had three children with his father. Therefore, he has two sisters, Erin and Eve Jobs.&nbsp;However, Reed also has a half-sister named Lisa Brennan-Jobs from his father’s relationship with a woman named Chrisann Brennan.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Reed_Paul_Jobs_Net_Worth></span>What Is Reed Paul Jobs’ Net Worth?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reed’s net worth is unknown, but his mother is worth $13.4 billion.

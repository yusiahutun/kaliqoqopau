Among those, few are Amy Walter and Kathryn Hamm who married in the circumstance when the same-sex marriage was illegal and are still living a wonderful life.</p><p>The editor of The Cook Political Report, Amy Walter, and Kathryn Hamm got married twice. The couple first married when the laws and notions of the society were utterly against same-sex marriage. Despite the hurdle, the couple managed to spend a healthy relationship for about two decades. Then, after the law became friendly towards LGBT group in 2013, the couple celebrated it getting married once again.</p><p>Let’s know in brief about their married life, relationship and children in our story today. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Amy Walter First Marriage and Husband:</h2><p>Amy Walter married Kathryn Hamm, owner <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">of gayweddings.com</a> and co<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">-author of capturing love:</a> The Art of Lesbian and Gay Wedding Photography, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on Labor Day Weekend 1999</a>. As we said, the same-sex marriage was not legalized during their first marriage. Kathryn shared with Equally Wed about their first marriage and how hopeless they were about the reforms in the law. She said:</p><p>”My partner, Amy, and I felt that we had tied the knot exceptionally well the first time and, because we live in the Commonwealth of Virginia, which bans same-sex marriage, we didn’t really believe that marriage equality would be coming our way in any time in the foreseeable future. Until this past summer.”</p><p>The beloved couple met through a mutual friend in 1993. &nbsp;Then, they moved to Clarendon in 1995 and got married soon after.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The couple adopted a son, Caleb in 2006,</a> who is ten years old now.</p><p></p><p><strong>Amy Walter and Kathryn Hamm with their son Caleb in 2016&nbsp;</strong>(liverampup.com)</p><p>The lesbian couple is thoroughly enjoying their parental life regardless, of what the society thinks. Kathryn shared about her unique <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family with The Barker Adoption in January 2016</a>. She said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Our neighbors and friends have seen us only as a family. Our son sees us as his parents, and we see him as our child. Of course, there were always boxes to check on forms, and forms biased for “mother” and “father” pairings to remind us, but we didn’t spend a lot of time on our difference.</p><p>The couple married again on November 2, 2013, after the government issued some legal benefits for the same-sex marriage. Their first marriage was held as per the tradition but the second marriage became more casual and relaxed. Don’t you want to know how the marriage was conducted?? Let’s hear Kathryn Hamm explain about her second marriage.</p><p>“We did it on a Saturday morning at the courthouse and then walked a few blocks for a delicious barbecue lunch. […] I think Amy summarized it best during a toast. For our legal marriage ceremony, there were more wrinkles, more gray hair and more kids!”</p><p>“In the company of 160 friends and family members (including a few dozen children), we reflected upon what marriage means and what our first wedding meant; we honored in a sand ceremony our family unit (me, Amy and our young son) as a forever family; we enjoyed a community poem on love inspired by the words of our youngest guests; and we re-exchanged our wedding bands while revisiting the promises we made to one another over fourteen years ago.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Take a look at the blissful couple's wedding picture.</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p></p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>equallywed.com(4)</strong></p><p>Don’t they look overwhelmed by happiness??</p><p>Amy Walter and Kathryn Hamm are indeed delighted with one another. It’s sweet how they both talk about each other. Let’s find out what Amy loves about Kathryn which she told this in an interview with the online magazine, equally wed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love how willing Kathryn is to put her heart on her sleeve. She fights for what she believes in, even when she knows that she could be deeply disappointed and hurt. And, even then, she never stops believing that she will be able to make a difference.”</p><p>Amy and her husband, Kathryn’s love, live biography can be&nbsp;an example to all same-sex couples. Despite the hard criticisms, they have stayed committed and happy in the relation. It has already been twenty-three years since the couple started a relationship.

By the 1980’s, Bergeron had become known in his community as a local DJ. He played music and interviewed artist of all kinds, honing his ability to speak to talent.</p><p id=par-6_53>WBZ Radio in Boston noticed Bergeron’s knack for entertaining the public, so they gave him his own show — aptly named&nbsp;The Tom Bergeron Show&nbsp;— in the early 1990s. Bergeron also took on several commentating and reporting jobs during this time. All of those experiences eventually allowed him to break into the television landscape.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tom Bergeron is the host with the most</h2><p id=par-7_35>Bergeron made his television debut on the game show&nbsp;Granite State College. The WHEN-TV program put teams of four New Hampshire high school students against each other to answer various questions and test their knowledge.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_24>After his time on Granite State College, Bergeron continued to do more television, honing is craft and becoming the host we know today.</p><p id=par-9_17>Eventually, Bergeron replaced host Buzz Luttrell on&nbsp;People Are Talking — a series that&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Oprah Winfrey once co-hosted</a>&nbsp;in Baltimore.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bergeron helped changed the morning television format</h2><p id=par-10_26>Throughout his career, Bergeron hosted several morning talk shows, including&nbsp;Breakfast Time&nbsp;in 1994. He co-hosted the show with Bob, who just happened to be a puppet.</p><p id=par-11_45>The morning news show was coveted by many, mostly because its format was unlike any other. The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>LA Times</a>&nbsp;called Breakfast Time “choreographed chaos” because it was just the kind of “grand nonsense” people who had just rolled out of bed wanted to see in the morning.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_26>Breakfast Time&nbsp;was a show for people “who roll out of bed hungering for fun, not headlines,” and Bergeron played a large role in making it that.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_15>After seeing how well Bergeron performed on&nbsp;Breakfast Time, ABC executives wanted him on&nbsp;Good Morning America.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tom Bergeron became part of America’s family</h2><p id=par-14_34>Today, many people are most familiar with Bergeron’s work as a television host.

Previously, she was a sales manager supervising logistics in runaways and modelling agencies. It is through her profession that she met the love of her life, Marcus.</p><p class=align-left>During the 2016 COTERIE trade show, a conference bringing like-minded business people for sales and investments, Robbi met Marcus. According to Bobbi Raffel’s husband, she was the one who made the first move as she tapped on his shoulder, asking him to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> buy her fashion business</a>.</p><p class=align-left>After talking business over the phone for a while, Lemonis decided to acquire her business, and shortly after, the two began dating the same year.</p><h3>When Did Marcus Lemonis get married?</h3><p class=align-left>After dating for almost one year, Marcus decided to pop the big question during Christmas in 2017. The business tycoon proposed in style by pulling off a surprise proposal using a gift from Santa, after which the two became officially engaged.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f32863c147a96f88.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melanie Bright: 5 interesting facts about Lynette Nusbacher's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did Marcus from the profit get married? Bobbi and Marcus Lemonis had planned on having their wedding in January in Montecito, California, but due to unforeseen mudslides and fires, they had to reschedule the wedding. For this reason, they had an intimate ceremony with <a href=#>family</a> and close friends that occurred at Hotel Bel-Air in February 2018.</p><p class=align-left>The couple’s wedding event was graced with outfit changes and an entire weekend of partying. Since Marcus and Bobbi are not from the same faith, their wedding was one of a kind as it had both a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">priest and a cantor</a> officiating their marriage.</p><p class=align-left>To add, Lemonis and Raffel had a unique honeymoon. The Profit superstar needed to film his episodes, so his wife offered to assist as opposed to going for a vacation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg><p class=align-left>Prior to meeting Bobbi, Marcus Lemonis had been romantically involved in other relationships.

Bobbi was previously linked to one Mr. Lee Raffel, who is also believed to be the father to their children, as indicated in Bobbi’s father obituary.</p><p class=align-left>Raffel is a delighted parent to two grown-up children, a daughter, and a son.

Since Roberta is an avid business person, she assists her spouse in the managing of his companies.. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">invested $1.3 million</a> into one of his most successful firms, Camping World.</p><p class=align-left>For this reason, she is one of the co-owners of Camping World, a company selling camping merchandise and recreational vehicles, with over 99,094 (52%) shares to her name.</p><p class=align-left>However, even with her four decades of experience in business and entrepreneurship, Bobbi Raffel net worth still remains unknown. Following her union to business maestro Marcus, her net worth has since augmented drastically as the reality TV star is worth about $900 million that he earns from his numerous business ventures.</p><p class=align-left>Bobbi Raffel became famous after her involvement with business guru Marcus Lemonis. Even though she is two decades older than her husband, it is evident that they are content in their matrimony. Besides, they have managed to separate their personal life from business excellently, and it is admirable. We wish them all the best in their marriage and businesses.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9dff4ccdb117916d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sarah Levy: husband, mother, siblings, net worth, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published <a href=#>Anne Steves and Rick</a> Steves relationship and quick facts.

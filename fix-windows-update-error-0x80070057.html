As such, it isn't an entirely difficult error to fix, and we can show you exactly how to take care of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-the-windows-error-code-0x80070057-mean>What Does the Windows Error Code 0x80070057 Mean?</h2><p>The 0x80070057 error code means that Windows ran into a storage issue. Possibly, your hard drive or SSD didn't have enough space left to download or copy files. But this error could also signal a file system incompatibility, a corrupt hard drive, or any other storage-related issue.</p><h3 id=unknown-error-unspecified-parameters-service-not-running>Unknown Error; Unspecified Parameters; Service Not Running</h3><p>The message arriving with error 0x80070057 can vary, depending on where the error in the update service is found, but it is usually a variant of "Unknown error," "Unspecified parameters encountered," or simply that the "Required services are not running."</p><p>The update service or the activity you were engaged with then ends, plonking you firmly back to square one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Windows Update in particular, namely the 2016 Windows 10 Anniversary Update, or Windows 10 Build 1607, saw numerous reports of the error. As this error usually relates to the Windows Update process, many users were unhappy with it. The update either left an uncompleted update process and temporarily "breaking" the system, or were simply forced back to Windows 10 Build 1507 (aka Threshold 1). Unfortunately, the error hasn't disappeared since.</p><p>Error 0x80070057 usually occurs when:</p><ul><li>You are trying to back up your files, and there is corruption.</li><li>You are trying to install a Windows operating system and the System Reserved Partition is corrupted.</li><li>Corrupt registry or policy entries are interfering with the Windows Update process.</li><li>There were some problems installing updates, and the system will attempt to try again later.</li></ul><p>All jolly irritating, all jolly fixable.</p><h2 id=11-common-ways-to-fix-error-code-0x80070057>11 Common Ways to Fix Error Code 0x80070057</h2><p>The frustrating thing about error code 0x80070057 is that you rarely know what exactly caused it. If it happened during a Windows Update, chances are you ran out of storage space. But it's really just an educated guess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'll take you through all potential fixes, starting with the most common and easy ones. If you received a specific error message, see if we covered it below.</p><h3 id=clear-drive-space>1. Clear Drive Space</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Windows-Disk-Cleanup-System-Files.jpg><p>Error 0x80070057 often shows up along with Windows Update since update files can be humongous. Moreover, when Windows performs a whole system update, it stores the old version in a folder called Windows.old, which can take up many gigabytes of storage space; more than you might have available.</p><p>hat's typically when Windows Update fails. But it's not the only time this error can show up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To see how much space is left on your system drive, press <strong>Win + E</strong> to launch the File Explorer and head to <strong>This PC</strong>. If it looks like it could be tight, right-click the drive, select <strong>Properties > Disk Cleanup > Clean up system files</strong>. Check everything that can go, especially the <strong>Recycle Bin</strong> and <strong>Windows Update Cleanup</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong> and confirm with <strong>Delete Files</strong>. If you'd prefer to keep Windows Update files for recovery, you can skip the System Files step and start from Disk Cleanup.</p><p>Still running into the error? Try <a href=#>clearing more Windows storage space</a> or proceed with the following solutions.</p><h3 id=sync-the-windows-date-and-time>2. Sync the Windows Date and Time</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Windows-Date-and-Time-Settings.jpg><p>When your Windows clock is out of sync, it can cause all kinds of issues, including error code 0x80070057. While this one isn't a common cause, it tends to be easy to fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, check the time and date by clicking the time in the far right of the Windows Taskbar. If it looks right, we can skip this step, but if it doesn't align with the actual time and date, here's how to fix it:</p><p><strong>Windows 11:</strong> Press <strong>Win + I</strong> to launch the Settings app, then go to <strong>Time & language > Date & time</strong></p><p><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Right-click the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and select <strong>Adjust date/time</strong>.</p><p>We recommend enabling the following options:</p><ul><li>Set time automatically</li><li>Adjust for daylight saving time automatically</li><li>Set time zone automatically</li></ul><p>With those set, click <strong>Sync now</strong>, just to be sure. If you find that <a href=#>your Windows time keeps getting thrown out of sync</a>, there might be a deeper issue.</p><h3 id=check-windows-update>3.

To check whether you have pending update, press <strong>Win + I</strong> and follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Windows 11:</strong> From the Settings app, select the <strong>Windows Update</strong> option, then click <strong>Check for updates.</strong></p><p><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Go to <strong>Update & Security</strong>, and click <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</p><p>Install any pending updates, then try again.</p><h3 id=run-chkdsk>4.

This Windows tool scans your entire hard drive and can also identify defective hardware.</p><p>To run Chkdsk, press <strong>Win + E</strong> to launch the File Explorer, then head to <strong>This PC</strong>, right-click the <strong>system drive</strong>, and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From here, switch to the <strong>Tools</strong> tab, click <strong>Check</strong>, then click <strong>Scan drive</strong>. The scan will happen in the background. In case any issues are found, you can choose what to do with them. We recommend fixing them and restarting your system.</p><h3 id=use-the-system-file-checker>5. Use the System File Checker</h3><p>Windows has <a href=#>an inbuilt System File Checker tool</a> we can use to scan the system for any potentially corrupted files. This tool will detail and potentially fix any unexpected corruptions, returning the system to a good working state.</p><p>Open an elevated Command Prompt by right-clicking the Start Menu and selecting <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> or <strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin)</strong>. Now run the following command:</p><pre><code class=hljs>sfc /scannow</code> </pre><p>This command can take a little time to complete. Do not close the Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. On completion, you'll receive one of the following messages:</p><ul><li><strong>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</strong> Your system did not contain any corrupted files; you need to try another fix for this issue</li><li><strong>Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</strong> You need to reboot your system into Safe Mode, then run the command</li><li><strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.

<time>10 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>FANS of TV veteran Eamonn Holmes have been left shocked by the news he's quit This Morning after 15 years.</p><p>But here we take a look at the clues planted MONTHS ago that he was <a href=#>plotting to join GB News.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/a92e4edc-1bf8-46fa-a109-81875eeaaafe.jpg><h3>Swipe at bosses over 'sacking'</h3><p>DESPITE being a huge hit with viewers on his regular Friday slot, <a href=#>Eamonn</a> - and his wife Ruth - were surprisingly replaced by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary.</p><p>The pair previously impressed bosses when<a href=#>&nbsp;they hosted the show together last summer</a>&nbsp;and producers were keen to add more diversity to the line-up.</p><p>But it meant Eamonn and Ruth were "relegated" to being holiday cover for Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.</p><p>And it appears the star was unhappy with the decision.</p><p>He liked a tweet which read: "When you listen to @EamonnHolmes & @RuthieeL and the everyday normal things they get up to, it makes you wonder why management at @thismorning have relegated them to holidays only?</p><p>"They deserve a regular spot."</p><p>The swipe at bosses back in August appears to be a clear sign of tension behind the scenes.</p><h3>Phillip Schofield 'feud'</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bc6f7119-367f-4a32-b125-067155f25559.jpg><p>RUTH famously had a falling out with Phillip Schofield in 2019 when The Sun revealed she'd <a href=#>made an official complaint against him.</a></p><p>Meanwhile eight other ITV presenters spoke about what they described as a “toxic” environment at&nbsp;<a href=#>This Morning</a>.</p><p>Their bust-up came after Phillip rudely interrupted her while she was presenting a preview of&nbsp;<a href=#>Loose Women</a>&nbsp;during an episode of This Morning.</p><p>In the clip, the presenters clash after&nbsp;<a href=#>Phil</a> cuts a Loose Women segment short, with&nbsp;<a href=#>Ruth</a>&nbsp;slamming her pen down in fury.</p><p>The presenter was left furious after the on-air spat and Ruth complained to ITV’s embattled new head of daytime TV Emma Gormley over Phillip’s conduct.</p><p>Things flared at the NTAs 2020 when&nbsp;<a href=#>the pair exchanged a VERY awkward hug</a>&nbsp;during an acceptance speech for Best Live Magazine Show.</p><p>Although Ruth has never spoken publicly about the clash, Eamonn appears to have his wife's back.</p><p>He liked a series of shady tweets about Phil in September for "not letting him and Ruth speak at NTAs".</p><p>The This Morning team picked up the gong for Best Daytime programme and all headed to the stage to collect it, but it was just Holly Willoughby and <a href=#>Phil </a>who were given the chance to speak.</p><p>Many spotted what appeared to be a frosty atmosphere between the rival presenters.</p><p>And <a href=#>Eamonn</a> added fuel to the fire by liking shady tweets about Phil.</p><p>One message he liked read: “Last night I watched the NTV Awards and saw @thismorning add another trophy to the collection. It wouldn't have won if the judging had been based on today's mind numbing programme &nbsp;@EamonnHolmes you are so very missed and you so deserved to be on that stage last night x”</p><p>Another tweet read: “People asking why @EamonnHolmes @RuthieeL didn't talk at the #awards That's what I was thinking i was waiting for them to take the mic it never happened such a #shame that's why i voted for @thismorning i wont again.”</p><p>While a third he was a fan of said: “Why do @EamonnHolmes or @RuthieeL never get to speak when #ThisMorning wins an award? It's them we voted for!.”</p><h3>Eamonn feared he'd be 'cancelled' by the 'anti-woke brigade</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/a295de00-323a-457a-8f8f-dbefa7d81267.jpg><p>THE TV star is departing This Morning after 15 years for a new job at 'anti-woke' channel GB News.</p><p>It's thought he will be fronting his own show on GB News 'several times a week' and is expected to start next year.</p><p>His sudden move comes after Earmonn came under fire last year&nbsp;when he suggested there could be a link between 5G masts and the spread of killer disease coronavirus.</p><p>Last April Ofcom received over 400 complaints after Eamonn&nbsp;<a href=#>said he believes there could be something to the claims</a>&nbsp;linking 5G and coronavirus.</p><p>The host later clarified that he doesn't believe the theory that 5G has caused&nbsp;<a href=#>coronavirus</a>&nbsp;is valid, and was simply "looking for answers", but his comments reportedly infuriated ITV bosses.</p><p>Therefore the move to GB News might not surprise fans as just a couple of months ago the&nbsp;<a href=#>veteran TV host&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;admitted worrying about saying the wrong thing and said it was time to "stand up to the woke".</p><p>“It’s a minefield, it’s a total worry all the time," reports the Daily Star.</p><p>“I don’t wake up in the morning and say, ‘I’m going to say something offensive to somebody’.</p><p>“I know I’m the most tolerant, caring, open-minded person but that doesn’t stop me saying that something is wrong or right, or having a joke.</p><p>“But there are people who wake up wanting to be offended and they literally want you sacked."</p><p>He added:&nbsp;“I do think we need him to stand up to woke."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><h3>'Too pale, stale and male'</h3><p>A TV insider<a href=#>&nbsp;previously told The Sun that Eamonn feared he was "too pale, stale and male"</a> to remain a regular face on the show for much longer.</p><p>Eamonn and Ruth had presented Friday's episode of This Morning since 2006 - but after a shake-up they are now only called in during the school holidays when the main hosts have time off.</p><p>It's believed the couple were axed as part of a diversity drive on This Morning.</p><h3>He publicly supported GB News</h3><p>DESPITE being one of ITV's biggest stars, Eamonn insisted it was only fair to give GB News "a chance" when it launched amid controversy from viewers.</p><p>He said at the time: “We need a shake-up on the news front. I have huge respect for TV news but this is a reminder news is not just Westminster or a constant woke agenda.”</p><p>GB News began broadcasting in June with the aim of providing more opinion and debate unlike news rivals Sky News and BBC News.</p><p>Eamonn will be work alongside presenters such as Nigel Farage, Dan Wootton and Simon McCoy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Andrew Neil stepped down as chairman just a couple of months after it went on air.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Eamonn Holmes quits This Morning after 15 years</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlmbH5zfpdtZpykpZrAbrHApqanpl2dvK25xKxkqq2ZqXq1tMisZKanoqO2r7OMpqanrJioeqKzzmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclues-eamonn-holmes-quit-this-morning-months-ago.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fclues-eamonn-holmes-quit-this-morning-months-ago.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fclues-eamonn-holmes-quit-this-morning-months-ago.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fclues-eamonn-holmes-quit-this-morning-months-ago.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclues-eamonn-holmes-quit-this-morning-months-ago.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclues-eamonn-holmes-quit-this-morning-months-ago.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./crown-princess-mary-of-denmark-coronation-outfit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./crown-princess-mary-of-denmark-coronation-outfit.html>Crown Princess Mary of Denmark is every inch a Queen in angelic white outfit stitched by her wedding</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./susan-lapierre.html>Susan LaPierre Bio, Age, Net Worth, Husband, &amp;amp; Children</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./susan-lapierre.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

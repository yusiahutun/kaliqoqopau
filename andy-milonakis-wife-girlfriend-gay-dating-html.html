However, his personal life outside the Twitter has been veiled.</p><p>And whats more, the secret behind his young looks and his real age has always been a source of gossip to many.</p><h2>Andy Milonakis Dating?</h2><p>Weirdly funny Andy Milonakis is famed for his quirky and hilarious videos on YouTube, which are not similar to conventional comedy&nbsp;videos. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The comedian not only posts quirky comedy videos on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a> channel, but he also boasts a very funny Twitter feed.</p><p>And the feed is full of mentions regarding&nbsp;wives&nbsp;and girlfriends, with anecdotes about him cheating on her girlfriend. Similarly, there are desperate tweets about getting a Canadian&nbsp;wife to get a permanent Canadian residency if he falls in love with the Toronto city.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Then there is a rap battle with rapper Lil Phag&nbsp;where he claims that 'But I'm Not A Gay' would be his punchline about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lil Phag</a> being an openly gay and him being straight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Andy Milonakis with singer Rita Ora in 2017</strong> (Photo: Andy Milonakis' Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And the chubby comedian shared about the facet of his life that had remained hidden for a long time.

However, the announcement came with a twist, the comedian's girlfriend was a full-sized sex doll.</p><p>Not only did the comedian announce Dolores as his girlfriend, but&nbsp;he also committed to sharing screen space with her in all his upcoming YouTube videos. The comedian was further captured getting Dolores a bath in a tub full of Orbeez. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite sharing numerous stories about&nbsp;wife and girlfriend, the dryly humorous comedian is still single and&nbsp;probably waiting for his perfect partner.

And he also found out that the kid was suffering from a congenital growth hormone deficiency that made him look in his teens despite being much older than that.</p><p>Jimmy found Andy a job in his show, Jimmy Kimmel Live as a correspondent, and by 2005, he had his show, The Andy Milonakis Show on MTV.

<time>16 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Johnny Depp has been in the news for various reasons. The most famous incident was his ex-wife’s allegation of domestic violence against him and the subsequent lawsuit. Though Johnny Depp won the case against <a href=#>Amber Heard</a>, he made headlines again for his teeth. He shocked fans during his appearance at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival because of his rotten teeth. So, what happened to Johnny Depp’s teeth, and why is he proud of them?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-05-18-at-1.37.14-PM-1-1024x622.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Netizens_Disapproved_of_Johnny_Depps_Teeth></span>Netizens Disapproved of Johnny Depp’s Teeth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “Pirate of the Caribbean” actor renowned for his role as Jack Sparrow returned to the limelight in preparation for the release of his new film “Jeanne du Barry.” In it, he portrays the character of King Louis XV. However, releasing online photographs from the event featuring the actor has left much to be desired about Johnny Depp’s appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous social media users flocked to Twitter to express their opinions about Depp’s teeth. Some claimed his teeth were in a state of decay. Although a remnant among his fans eagerly welcomed the actor’s presence on the red carpet, others were dismayed by his appearance. Those appalled by Depp’s appearance highlighted the unappealing brown hue and alleged deterioration of his teeth.</p><p>Some Twitter fans called them “disgusting” and “mood-killing.” It is hard to certify who exactly is Depp’s fans, but the comments kept pouring in as some netizens joked that the actor looked like he had “eaten a bag of charcoal.”</p><p>One person wrote, “Johnny Depp’s teeth are ROTTING,” and another wrote: “Johnny Depp’s teeth are crying out for help.” Another Twitter user wrote: “I was today years old when I found out that Johnny Depp’s teeth in Pirates of the Caribbean were essentially not altered.”</p><p>It is hard to determine whether this last allegation is true. However, one thing is sure: Johnny Depp’s teeth haven’t looked pleasing in a long while, and his appearance at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival showed its worsening state.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Johnny-Depp-Teeth-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Johnny_Depps_Reactions_at_the_2023_Cannes_Film_Festival></span>Johnny Depp’s Reactions at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On May 17, 2023, the actor embraced the spotlight at the Cannes Film Festival. He participated in a press conference, seizing the opportunity to field questions after the premiere of his latest film at the festival the previous day.</p><p>During the conference, Depp confronted the topic of his departure from the “Fantastic Beasts” franchise in 2020, triggered by the emergence of abuse allegations. He directly responded to speculations of being “boycotted” by Hollywood in the aftermath of these allegations made by his ex-wife, Amber Heard.</p><p>In his responses, Depp told <a href=#>Variety</a>,</p><p>“Did I feel boycotted by Hollywood? You’d have to not have a pulse to feel like, ‘No. None of this is happening. It’s a weird joke. When you’re asked to resign from a film you’re doing because of something that is merely a function of vowels and consonants floating in the air, yes, you feel boycotted.”</p><p>He added: “I don’t feel boycotted by Hollywood because I don’t think about Hollywood. It’s a strange, funny time where everybody would love to be able to be themselves, but they can’t. They must fall in line with the person in front of them. I wish you the best if you want to live that life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/9673e946f25b7042edefb0bc66138b97.jpg><p>Though Johnny Depp seemingly used his time in the limelight to promote himself and his craft, his fans had a more sensitive issue of concern to address; his teeth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Are_the_Speculations_About_Johnny_Depps_Teeth></span>What Are the Speculations About Johnny Depp’s Teeth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For some years now, Johnny Depp’s teeth have been a subject of speculation. The star admitted in 2018 that he was struggling with drug and alcohol addiction, leading some to argue that his poor dentition is linked to the abuse. But, is it?</p><p>Celebrity dentist Dr. Apa has a divergent view. He told <a href=#>Page Six</a> that Johnny Depp’s dental state is because of “aggressive” wear and tear. Apa said, “He has wear, which has been a cumulative effect over a lifetime. Wear like that, sometimes, we see it in 30-year-olds in really aggressive cases. Sometimes we see it in cases like Depp, 59 years old.”</p><p>Apa also believes that Johnny Depp is to be blamed. He said that despite his passion for espresso and cigarillos, he hasn’t had his teeth cleaned out in years. But is that all there is to Depp’s teeth issue?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Has_Johnny_Depp_Said_About_His_Teeth></span>What Has Johnny Depp Said About His Teeth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many people and different groups already hold ideas about what is happening to Depp’s teeth. But what exactly has Johnny Depp said about his teeth?&nbsp;</p><p>Depp has never revealed the cause of his dental problems. He only came close during a 2016 interview where he said that he had been “neglecting” his teeth for years and was working to fix them. Has he though? It is uncertain!</p><p>It is increasingly likely he will not be interested in any extreme dental work. Johnny Depp has always been boastful about the condition of his teeth. In 1995, Depp bragged about having “rotten” teeth and “lots of cavities.” He told Premiere magazine, “I had a root canal done eight years ago that’s unfinished.” He called it a “rotten little stub” at the time.</p><p>Depp, who was 31, claimed he “liked” his flawed smile. He likened it to the kind of imperfection that the Indians would put on something beaded. The actor was also known to criticize fellow <a href=#>celebs</a> with perfect white teeth. He once said, “When I see people with perfect teeth, it drives me up the wall.</p><p>Johnny Depp’s teeth flaw has continued for almost three decades. However, it is unclear if he will pursue help, especially since it has been noted that his breath remained odorless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02afmqigmrumsIytpmain527r8WMnZypqKNiwaax06FkmqaUYsSpxYyiqmaglWK9s7vUnWSonl2ptaa5jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-depps-teeth-and-why-is-he-proud-of-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-depps-teeth-and-why-is-he-proud-of-them.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-depps-teeth-and-why-is-he-proud-of-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-depps-teeth-and-why-is-he-proud-of-them.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-depps-teeth-and-why-is-he-proud-of-them.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-depps-teeth-and-why-is-he-proud-of-them.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-compare-two-text-files-in-the-linux-terminal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-compare-two-text-files-in-the-linux-terminal.html>How to Compare Two Text Files in the Linux Terminal</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./travis-kelce-injury-status-chiefs-lions-2023.html>Is Travis Kelce playing tonight against the Lions: Latest Injury Status on ChiefsTE</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./travis-kelce-injury-status-chiefs-lions-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

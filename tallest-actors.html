<time>22 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>How many times have you spotted a hunk on TV or in a movie and Googled his height? When it comes to Hollywood, height can play a big role. But the tallest actors may not always be who you’d expect, thanks to almost a century of tricks of the trade used to make our leading men appear larger than they actually are.</p><p>For instance, when actor Alan Ladd (who was 5’6″) acted alongside Sophia Loren (who is 5’9″), the director dug a trench for her to walk in when they were arm-in-arm so she’d appear more petite next to him.&nbsp; Kirk Douglas (who was 5’7″) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had lifts put in his boots</a> after he was teased by a 6’2″ Burt Lancaster on the set of Gunfight at the OK Corral.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>While the average American male stands at 5’9″, and our handsome Hollywood favorites come in all shapes in sizes, we’re still curious to see which of heartthrobs are significantly taller than the average Joe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tallest actors ranked by height</h2><p>Here, our picks for the tallest and sexiest actors and a few fun facts about each.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Joe Manganiello height: 6’5”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-12.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Manganiello’s</a> film career began when he played Flash Thompson in Spider-Man.&nbsp;His breakout role was as werewolf Alcide Herveaux on the HBO series True Blood, but it was his killer dance moves in Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL that secured his place in the tall, dark and handsome category.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At 6’5″, Manganiello stands above most as one of the tallest actors in Hollywood. In an interview with ABC News, when speaking about the possibility of having children — before announcing his divorce from actress Sofia Vergara in July of 2023 — he joked about his offspring’s stature: “Male or female, he or she could be a professional basketball player. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He or she could have the height to do that!</a>”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. John Corbett height: 6’5”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-13.png><p>As Aidan Shaw on Sex and the City and its reboot And Just Like That, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Corbett</a> played Carrie Bradshaw’s sexy furniture maker and lover.&nbsp;He’s also starring in My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 that is out September 2023.</p><p>The handsome actor’s breakout role was in Northern Exposure, but it wasn’t his acting skills that earned him recognition. In an interview with The New York Times, he recalled: “I was the hunky guy and women would gush,” he said. “I don’t think one person has ever come up to me and said, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Hey, I think you’re a good actor.’</a>”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Dwayne Johnson height: 6’5”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-14.png><p>He came to our attention as professional wrestler, “The Rock,” but since 1999, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwayne Johnson</a> has been a box office success.&nbsp;At 51, his films have grossed over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the world’s highest grossing and highest paid actors.&nbsp;Good looks and great comedic timing make him a Hollywood favorite among the tallest actors.

Tim Robbins height: 6’5”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-15.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Robbins</a> definitely has left his deeply dimpled face and talented mark in show biz. Known for portraying Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption, he won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, a Golden Globe for his role in Mystic River and another Golden Globe for The Player.&nbsp; Fun fact: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Robbins is the tallest actor to win an Oscar!</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Jason Momoa height: 6’4”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-16.png><p>His acting debut on Baywatch: Hawaii made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a> a hunky TV star in a red bathing suit.&nbsp; He later showed off his towering physique in Game of Thrones and in his starring role as Aquaman. Rita Moreno, who met Momoa on the set of Fast X said to E! News: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa is the world’s tallest person,</a>” she said. “When I met him while I was there doing the film in England, I was actually talking to his belt. That man is so damn tall, literally. I mean he’s like way up here and you’re sort of looking at his belt and then go, ‘Hey, it’s me, Rita.,” the actress joked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Liam Neeson height: 6’4″</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-17.png><p>At 6’4″, this Irish actor dominates the screen in the roles he’s played. Known for his more serious and heroic characters in action films like Taken, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Neeson’s</a> brooding looks and tall stature make him the perfect fit for action-packed films of the sort.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Tom Selleck height: 6’4”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/1.png><p>With his mustache, shorts and Aloha shirts, the now 78-year-old actor rose to fame as the charismatic and sexy detective “Magnum, P.I.” and one of the tallest actors in Hollywood in the 1980s. Since 2010, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Selleck</a> began his run as the handsome New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan in Blue Bloods. (Click through to see <a href=#>throwback photos of Tom Selleck young</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Alexander Skarsgard height: 6’4”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-19.png><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swedish born actor</a> had his breakthrough by portraying sexy, blue-eyed vampire Eric Northman on the True Blood series. He has since parlayed his smoldering looks into major roles in Big Little Lies as a handsome but abusive husband, a ruthless tech mogul in Succession and a Viking prince in Northman.&nbsp;</p><p>While Alexander Skarsgard is not exactly dark, he is tall and handsome. In fact, upon starting out, he told The Sunday Times of the struggle of being put into a box for his looks: “Starting out in Sweden, there was stuff about being tall and blond. But most people here are tall and blond. Still, after my first job, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was on a stupid ‘sexy hunky hot list’ and then people didn’t take me seriously</a>…If you want characters with depth but have been labeled ‘a dude who takes his shirt off,’ you’re not going to get those offers.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Clint Eastwood height: 6’4″</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-20.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clint Eastwood</a> is a man of many talents: not only is he an accomplished actor, but he also is an award winning director. Known as an actor for his work in Westerns, some of his most popular titles include The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars, Unforgiven, and Million Dollar Baby, to name a few. With rugged good looks in his youthful prime and a 6’4″ stature, it’s no surprise this cowboy has amassed such a loyal fan base over the years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Donald Sutherland &nbsp;height: 6’4”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-21.png><p>The now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">88-year-old actor</a> proves age is no barrier to tall and handsome.&nbsp;The Canadian star’s film career spans over six decades, and Donald Sutherland’s works range from the Hunger Games to Pride & Prejudice. He is considered one of the most personable on our tallest actors round-up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Jared Padalecki height: 6’4”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-22.png><p>The 41-year-old Texas native<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Jared Padalecki </a>had small parts before he was cast as Dean Forester on Gilmore Girls, which earned him a legion of female fans.&nbsp;However, he’s best known as Sam Winchester in the TV series Supernatural and now plays the lead on Walker, a reboot of Chuck Norris’ Walker Texas Ranger. Fun fact: Despite his tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold reputation, Chuck Norris is not one of the tallest actors. Topping out a 5’9″, he on par with the national male average.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. Ben Affleck height: 6’4”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-23.png><p>A 50-year-old Boston native, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck</a> has been associated with some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood: Jennifer Garner, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ana de Armas, Jennifer Lopez.&nbsp;But it’s his Hollywood resume that has risen him to hunky heights as a writer, actor and director —Good Will Hunting, Hollywoodland and Argo are just a few of his biggest titles.&nbsp;He has graced the screen in more than 50 films, earning many accolades for his talents.&nbsp;</p><p>His wife, Jennifer Lopez, revealed on Live with Kelly and Mark the reason she’s usually pictured a step behind her husband, who is one of the tallest actors: “Ben is 6’4, and I am tiny — I’m smaller. I’m like, 5’6. But we make it work.” She continues, “He’s taller and his arm’s up, and I walk like a step behind, just to compensate, which I’m fine with.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13. John Wayne height: 6’4″</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-24.png><p>At 6’4″, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wayne</a> joins Clint Eastwood in the club of looming cowboys. A golden age movie star, his work ranged from silent films to Westerns. His heartthrob status often put him aside some of Hollywood’s biggest starlets, from Sophia Loren to Claire Trevor. And even thought it’s been more than four decades since his passing in 1979, he’s still a standard for masculine, handsome Hollywood hunks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>14. Jeff Goldblum height: 6’4″</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Copy-of-side-by-side-25.png><p>The Jurassic Park and Thor: Ragnarok actor towers at 6’4″.

Really?’” He continued, “Looked in the mirror, I checked myself out. I was like, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Yeah, you are kind of sexy today.’</a> But to be honest, it was just a nice feeling. It was a nice surprise — an ego boost for sure.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>16.

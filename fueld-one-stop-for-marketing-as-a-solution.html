Since technology has taken over, various avenues have come up for businesses via innovation and extensive research. Brands have given more importance to customer experience lately and devoted themselves to customer retention. To make this process more efficient, various Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software have come up in the global market. The collaboration of Information Technology (IT) and CRM has exploded the brands’ reach into the markets. An example of this is <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Fueld</strong></a>, an epitome of innovation and expertise.&nbsp;</p><p>Fueld’s gigantic experience of 30 years and its stronghold of HubSpot and IT marketing have made it successful in developing an innovative solution concept, Marketing As a Service (MaaS). The company has also been awarded the Small Business Award for this novel concept. With a monthly fixed rate, it supports clients in online lead generation and cross-selling. This concept drives the company to focus on their core business. It ensures voluntary marketing efforts and leads to substantial online growth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The CRM Wizard</h2><p><strong>Marielle Dellemijn</strong>, <strong>Co-founder</strong> of Fueld, completed her graduation in commercial economics and gained about ten years’ experience in the field. She was a driving character behind the success of one of the pioneer CRM software&nbsp; companies in the Netherlands. In 1999, the company was sold and she started her next venture, CRM excellence, with three colleagues. Being CRM specialists, they guided clients with CRM strategy, business processes, and CRM selections.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, Marielle co-founded Fueld, where she is a knowledge partner for marketing teams, guiding projects from strategy to implementation. She has also been a member of the Forbes Business Council for 3 years. The diverse international composition of the group added immense value to her knowledge and she is proud to be a part of it. She also actively contributed to the Dutch Association of Supervisors and Directors (NCD) as a member of the Groningen district, was part of the board of the Dutch Sales Management Association and is also involved with the Rotary in her hometown Groningen.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Products Fuelled with CRM Expertise</h2><p>Fueld’s offerings enable companies to flawlessly integrate the specialized online team as an extension of the marketing department.

It was a complex and diverse field that needed various expertise to proof its value. The two key challenges faced by Fueld were:</p><ul><li>Building on expertise</li><li>Patience and conviction to pave the way in the market via digital marketing</li></ul><p>The guiding principle for the company is “practice what you preach”. By depicting expertise, the company establishes leadership and empowers partners to elevate their <a href=#>online marketing strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Surging Growth</h2><p>The turning point that propelled the growth of Fueld was the value addition for its customers. The company focuses on value creation for the customer, rather than focusing on growth. It believes that if growth is necessary to add value for the customers, it will grow. “Growth is the result of adding value”– the basic principle of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Entrepreneurial Obligations- Marielle’s Perspective</h2><p>As an entrepreneur, Marielle takes responsibility for the well-being of her customers and colleagues. She ensures that the company will remain agile and competitive so that it remains prosperous in the future.

She aims to have a positive impact on society with her entrepreneurship and be influential in her field.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sustained Success</h2><p>Fueld’s long-standing success stems from the future vision and focus on lasting client relationships, rather than short-term gains. It comes across as a trusted partner as it constantly strives to add value for its customers. The team has tremendous experience in the respective fields. The various skills seamlessly integrate into the MAAS concept making it quantifiable and feasible. This enables it to operate efficiently and effectively, which contributes to its success.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Balanced Environment for Employees</h2><p>Fueld’s team prioritizes a blend of freedom and responsibility. It aims to provide everyone with the opportunity to develop in his/her way. A balance between fun and professionalism is perfectly handled at the company.

Also, the company understands customer requirements and fulfills them with new developments, products, or services.

Combining information from online channels with CRM is essential for success. Fueld accommodates these elements together which sets it apart from other companies. With extensive experience in both areas, the unique combination is incomparable.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Significant Triumphs</h2><p>Marielle has built and maintained successful organizations for over 30 years.

It follows market trends and keeps the organizations gainful. It is the result of hard work, dedication, and adding value for the clients.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Candid with Marielle</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Here are some excerpts from The Enterprise World’s fascinating conversation with Marielle.&nbsp;</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Q.1.</strong> Can you tell us which your favorite book is? And your favorite part of the book (if any)?&nbsp;</h4><p>I don’t have a favorite book, but I do have favorite authors. For instance, I’m a big fan of Tony Robbins. I learned a lot from him during my participation in his Master’s University program. His insights on personal development and communication are invaluable in my daily life. I also admire Seth Godin as a world-class marketing thinker.</p><p>His ideas and inspiration have helped me develop many new concepts. Deepak Chopra is another source of inspiration for me. He uniquely combines Western and Eastern healing methods and thoughts. Attending his events has always been a highlight for me. His ability to speak to a group without notes and still share interesting insights is truly admirable. These three authors have inspired me and enriched my perspective on life.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Q.2. One person who you admire the most?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>I admire not just one, but many individuals. Countless people contribute something valuable to the world. I cherish those committed to positive change and hope their inspiring example motivates others to make a difference, too.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Q.3. Whose business story do you find the most inspiring?&nbsp;</h4><p>I find inspiration in entrepreneurs who bring their business ideas to life with conviction, going against the current to chase their dreams. It doesn’t have to be a multinational, as long as someone takes risks and pursues their goals wholeheartedly. It takes courage, perseverance, and passion.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Q.4. Which is the most inspiring quote you have read?&nbsp;</h4><p>After my mother’s passing, I received a card from my niece, with a quote that has left a lasting impression on me: “Tears are the words that the heart can’t say”. It reminds me that in the business world, we often forget to listen to our feelings and intentions. We often wear masks and play a role, but true strength lies in authenticity and the courage to show our vulnerabilities. As an entrepreneur, you become stronger and better equipped to grow when you dare to be yourself and embrace vulnerability.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Q.5. Constant vigilance- a need or a strategy? Please share your views.&nbsp;</h4><p>For me, neither. Being vigilant implies fear of unpleasant events. Instead, I rely on my strength and abilities. It doesn’t mean I’m naive, but I believe in my ability to handle challenges and overcome setbacks. This strategy gives me satisfaction and confidence in approaching life.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Q.6. It’s a rat race out there. How do you cope with that?&nbsp;</h4><p>I strive to minimize my involvement in the rat race by staying authentic and prioritizing customer and employee needs over financial gain as much as possible. Though there are successful moments, it can be challenging when facing competition from those with different values and beliefs. Nevertheless, I’m not overly concerned. Our goal is not to conform, but to stay true to ourselves and follow our path. We simply do things our way and remain authentic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLO2scudZKimlWLAtbvPZp2oql2irrO3xK2gp59dlsBurYyspqWtpJ68rw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffueld-one-stop-for-marketing-as-a-solution.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffueld-one-stop-for-marketing-as-a-solution.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffueld-one-stop-for-marketing-as-a-solution.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffueld-one-stop-for-marketing-as-a-solution.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffueld-one-stop-for-marketing-as-a-solution.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffueld-one-stop-for-marketing-as-a-solution.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./article-09fd891d-1361-54e0-a634-95dcc98d5259-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./article-09fd891d-1361-54e0-a634-95dcc98d5259-html.html>Pro-police pastors son, 2 minors vandalize WJ | Local News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./darryl-mayes.html>Darryl Mayes - Bio, Age, Height, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./darryl-mayes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Megyn has played in more television roles than movies. She has starred in films like Mystery Alaska, Love Happens,<a href=#> Larry the Cable Guy</a>: Health Inspector, The Polar Bear, 3 Day Test, and others. Among all her TV roles, Grounded for Life has gained her more popularity, the highest since the beginning of her acting career. It is perhaps magical that most of her TV shows are always a hit with high target ratings. As a voice artist, she also worked in <a href=#>Seth MacFarlane</a>&nbsp;adult animated series American Dad. Megyn provided the voice of the character Linda Memari.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Ernestine Sclafani – Bio, Married, Husband, Affair, Quick Facts</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Megyn Price Biography</strong></h2><p>The star of Grounded for Life was born on 24 March 1971 in Seattle, Washington State. Megyn’s family belonged to the Mormon religion and she was raised as such. The names of her parents are not known. However, she has a brother named Joseph, a captain in the Air Force who is now a computer specialist. Megyn seems to be largely introverted by nature. In her spare time, the star actress loves cooking, writing, and gardening.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Megyn-Price-Bio.jpg><p>Although she was born in Washington, she spent much of her childhood and youth in Oklahoma, where she graduated from high school. Megyn attended Norman High School in Norman, Oklahoma. During her academic years there, she produced and wrote the play “Here comes the sun”. Although this seems to be an early sign of her flair and ability for the performing arts, Megyn never thought about taking acting seriously back then. In her words, she thought it was “the stupidest career choice you can ever make”.</p><p>As time went on, the opposite became true. For her college education, Megyn studied economics and communications at Stanford University. Still not seriously thinking about it, she continued to show active participation in school stage productions. She even went so far as to perform at the San Francisco Conservatory Theater. After graduating, the young lady, who has a good nose for numbers, got a job as an investment banker. After a year Megyn Price gave up the well-paid job to make room for acting, a passion she had denied for too long. She remembered that she was dissatisfied with every moment until she had made the big decision once and for all. So far, the former banker does not regret her move. She had her first television appearance in 1990 in the American Sci-Fi TV series “Quantum Leap”. In it, she played the role of Suzane, the daughter of a quantum physicist. Since then she has appeared in numerous films and more than ten television series such as LateLine, Common Law, Drop Dead Diva, and others. The Washington-born star is widely known for her comedic roles. She has appeared as a prominent judge in some reality cooking shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Megyn-Price-Career.jpg><p>According to reports, Megyn Price receives an average salary of $50,000 for her role in the Netflix series “The Ranch”. The salary is the same for other co-stars of the series. The millionaire actress lives in a $1.6 million house in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Inside Howard Stern’s Private Family Life: The Relationship With His Wife & Daughters</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Affairs, Boyfriend, Family Life</strong></h2><p>Megyn Price is a married woman and mother of one child.

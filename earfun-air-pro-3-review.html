They certainly don't look like a copy of the <a href=#>Apple AirPods Pro</a>, but they're not especially distinctive either. It's a simple design, but it works.</p><p>You shouldn't need to worry about taking the Air Pro 3 with you on a rainy day, as they're IPX5-rated water-resistant. This means they're <a href=#>splash-proof and sweat-proof</a>, but you don't want to submerge them in water.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) Review: The Best Earbuds for Apple Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A good fit is key for good sound---powerful bass, especially---and for effective noise cancellation. EarFun includes four different sizes of silicone tips here: extra small, small, medium, and large. That extra small size is handy if you typically have a tough time finding a good fit with earbuds.</p><p>As long as you find a tip size that works for you, the Air Pro 3s are comfortable to wear for hours. They're light enough to forget you're wearing them.</p><h2 id=connectivity-looking-toward-the-future>Connectivity: Looking Toward the Future</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/person-holding-a-pair-of-earfun-air-pro-3-buds.jpg><p>Since 2020, the <a href=#>Bluetooth Special Interest Group</a> has been talking up <a href=#>Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio</a> and the LC3 codec, which is supposed to sound better than the standard SBC codec, even while using a lower bitrate. The EarFun Air Pro 3 are some of the first affordable earbuds we've seen to include Bluetooth LE Audio and LC3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't worry if your phone or audio player doesn't support this codec, as the Air Pro 3s still feature the usual SBC codec, as well as AAC, which means better sound on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. If you're on an Android device, you'll need to rely on the other codecs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is a Codec?</a></span></p><p>If your phone supports Bluetooth 5.3, you may either have support for LC3 or receive it in a future <a href=#>firmware</a> update. This isn't the only alternative to SBC, however, as the Air Pro 3 earbuds also support aptX Adaptive. This doesn't have widespread support, but if your phone or other device supports it, it offers higher quality than the SBC codec.</p><p>The EarFun Air Pro 3s support <a href=#>multipoint Bluetooth</a> , meaning you can connect them to two devices at the same time for easy switching.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, the EarFun Air Pro 3 earbuds feature a Game Mode that <a href=#>lowers latency</a>. This isn't really necessary, as latency is fairly low when using the earbuds in any mode. That said, milliseconds matter in gaming, so it's certainly handy to have.</p><h2 id=controls-and-using-the-earfun-app-simple-but-solid>Controls and Using the EarFun App: Simple but Solid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/person-wearing-a-pair-of-earfun-air-pro-3-earbuds.jpg><p>There are no buttons on the Earfun Air Pro 3. Instead, you use a system of taps. For example, tapping twice on either earbud pauses and resumes playback or answers and ends calls. Tapping a single time on the right or left earbuds raises and lowers volume, respectively.</p><p>You can tap twice on the left earbud to cycle between normal, noise-canceling, and Ambient Sound modes. That said, for full control, you'll want to install the EarFun app, available for <a href=#>iPhone</a> as well as <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android devices</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>The app lets you update the firmware on your earbuds, though in my case, no update was necessary. You can also enable Game Mode and cycle through the various modes I mentioned earlier. The biggest reason to use the EarFun app, however, is the EQ feature.</p><p>You can set the six-band <a href=#>equalizer</a> to your own custom setting, or you can choose from the four presets. These are fairly basic, cutting and boosting either bass or treble, but they're a nice starting point for setting your own EQ curve.</p><h2 id=sound-quality-leave-the-noise-keep-the-bass>Sound Quality: Leave the Noise, Keep the Bass</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/person-holding-the-earfun-air-pro-3-case.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I've tested other EarFun products, mostly earbuds, and they always have a fun sound, even if it isn't especially neutral. The Air Pro 3 are similar in that while they aren't for audiophiles, they should sound good to most people, as long as you can find a good fit.</p><p>Listening to Ty Segall's "<a href=#>Harmonizer</a>," that powerful bass makes itself apparent immediately, though it leaves the midrange enough room. The stereo panning of various parts is very clear, but the soundstage isn't especially wide, not that this is unusual in earbuds.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>1MORE Aero Review: Affordable True Wireless Earbuds With Spatial Audio</a></span></p><p>Similarly, "<a href=#>Dance Floor</a>" by The Apples in Stereo has a lot of movement in the stereo field, and that translates well on the Air Pro 3, but again the soundstage isn't very wide. On the neutral EQ setting, which I used for the vast majority of my listening, the low end has plenty of thump, but the highs are treated nicely as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One aspect of the Air Pro 3 worth pointing out is that right out of the box, they sound great with audiobooks and podcasts. The spoken word, especially male speakers, often sounds too bass-heavy on earbuds. While other earbuds like the <a href=#>1MORE Aero</a> aim to fix this issue with a "podcast" EQ setting, the Air Pro 3 are a great set of earbuds if you mostly listen to podcasts or watch videos.</p><p>The <a href=#>active noise cancellation (ANC)</a> is surprisingly effective, though, like sound quality, this is highly dependent on finding a good fit. Even with nothing playing, enabling ANC significantly reduces noise. Play music or even a podcast or video, and you won't hear a thing.</p><p>Assuming you want to hear your surroundings, the Ambient Sound mode (aka <a href=#>Transparency Mode</a>) is surprisingly good. Apple and some others are still at the front, but cheaper options like the Air Pro 3s are catching up quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=microphone-audio-sample---indoors>Microphone Audio Sample - Indoors</h3><p></p><h3 id=microphone-audio-sample---outdoors>Microphone Audio Sample - Outdoors</h3><p></p><h2 id=battery-life-plenty-of-playtime>Battery Life: Plenty of Playtime</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/earfun-air-pro-3.jpg><p>EarFun claims a battery life of up to seven hours with ANC enabled, and up to nine hours with ANC disabled. Add in the extra charges from the case, and you get a total of up to 37 hours with ANC and up to 45 hours without.</p><p>I tested the battery life with ANC enabled and actually got slightly over seven hours on a single charge. That said, how much battery life you get out of a single charge depends heavily on volume, and I do tend to listen at a lower volume than many people.</p><p>The Air Pro 3 earbuds take an hour in the case to fully recharge, while the case charges in two hours over <a href=#>USB-C</a>. If you'd prefer to charge the case wirelessly, it will take around three and a half hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The earbuds feature fast charging, getting you up to two hours of playtime from a 10-minute charge.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-earfun-air-pro-3-earbuds>Should You Buy the EarFun Air Pro 3 Earbuds?</h2><p>The <a href=#>EarFun Air Pro 3</a> earbuds are a sort of jack of all trades when it comes to <a href=#>true wireless earbuds</a>. I can't think of any areas where they really stand out or excel, but I also can't think of any areas where they fail or fall short. They're not outstanding, but they're solid and, for the price, that's a selling point.</p><p>The larger overall drivers seem to be a recent trend in mid-range and high-end in-ears, so it's nice to see this included on the Air Pro 3. These drivers may have something to do with why the ANC and Ambient Sound mode work so well on a pair of earbuds in this price range.</p><p>If you're looking for quality earbuds at a decent price, you've got plenty of great options. That said, the inclusion of Bluetooth LE Audio and the LC3 codec, while not a game changer, does make the EarFun Air Pro 3 a comparatively future-proof pick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/earfun-air-pro-3.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>EarFun Air Pro 3</h5><p class=display-card-description></p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Myearfun</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvb3Flan1wscCrna6mXZa2s3nPq6Zma12nsre1xLBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fearfun-air-pro-3-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fearfun-air-pro-3-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fearfun-air-pro-3-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fearfun-air-pro-3-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fearfun-air-pro-3-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fearfun-air-pro-3-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-get-rid-of-mice.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-get-rid-of-mice.html>How to Get Rid of Mice, According to a Pest Control Expert</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./whos-afraid-islamists-not-widodo.html>Why Islamists, anti-Chinese sentiments dont worry Joko Widodo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./whos-afraid-islamists-not-widodo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

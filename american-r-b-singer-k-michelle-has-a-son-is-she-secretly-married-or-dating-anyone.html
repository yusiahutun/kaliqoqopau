She said in an interview,</p><p>“I’m not married, I”m in a relationship, we’ve been friends for over 19 years now. I just looked at him and said, ‘this is the type of man I should be with.

They even go to strip clubs and look for side chicks together and even compete to get numbers from different women.</p><p>She explained,</p><p>“I’m fun. Yeah, we were at the strip club and I was like, ‘Oh do you like her?’ Sometimes I’m okay with contracting out the work [that’s] less work for me to do.&nbsp;Yeah, we flirt. We’ll compete to see who can get the most numbers. We’ve always said this, we define the terms of our relationship. Not society’s norms, I and he decide. We value having a friendship, honesty, that’s what we value. ”</p><p>Looks like the bond between the dentist and the singer is getting stronger in a consistent manner. Well, some new members are soon to be added in their family flourishing their happiness to another level.</p><h2>Left Alone With A Baby In Hand, K. Michelle's Past Relationship Was A Hard One To Pass!</h2><p>The "Crazy Like You" singer is already a mother to a 14-year-old son named <strong>Chase Bowman</strong>. For several years, Chase's father was never known to the public but after few years she finally revealed on television about his father.</p><p><strong>Brian Bowman</strong>, whom she revealed on an episode of "K. Michelle: My Life surprising" the whole media and her fans. They had not been in touch for about 5 years.</p><p>She said,</p><p>"Reconnecting with Chase’s father was something that needed to be done so I could grow. I hadn’t seen Brian in years and we didn’t end on great terms but growing up, as a woman, I know it’s most important that my son has both parents in his life and that we do not fight."</p><p>Not many details about their relationship are known out in open but reports claim that they were together for a few years before finally splitting up. The reason behind their split was that Brian cheated on her with one of her sorority sisters while they were together.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/11/fabwags23.jpg alt="K Michelle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Brian Bowman is the father of Michelle's first child</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Fabwags</strong></p><p>She also mentions that she was really happy after clearing out things with Brian after he apologized for their breakup and are good friends to each other these days.

She was involved in a secret 8 months relationship with British actor <a href=#>Idris Elba </a>in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though their romance did not last long enough, they had some pretty good time during their romantic days. They met at the Soul Train Awards and hit it off right then. Their relationship was going pretty strong for several months until Elba's relationship with a make-up artist, <strong>Naiyana Garth</strong> came into light.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/11/vibe324.jpg alt="K Michelle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Michelle and Idris were together for 8 months until Idris cheated on her</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Vibe</strong></p><p>Michelle explains in an interview that she had no idea about Idris dating another woman. She stated,</p><p>‘When he took the baby momma – that I later found out about – to the [red] carpet they were trying to calm me down, I was tweeting a little stuff.&nbsp;But I didn’t know. I didn’t know that woman was pregnant and around him in the UK. He was so charming, it was like a movie.’</p><p>Since then, Michelle has been in a relationship with her fiance and is near in announcing her wedding ceremony.</p><h2>K.

The first season of the show had premiered on Netflix on February 21, 2020, whereas the 2nd season arrived on November 10, 2021.</p><p>For starters, Gentefied is the story of three Mexican-American cousins, namely Erik Morales, Ana Morales, Chris Morales. The show also chronicles their struggle to chase the “American dream,” even while that the dream could potentially shatter their dearest things: their immigrant grandfather, their neighborhood, the family taco shop.”</p><p>In this article, we will be talking about the actress Annie Gonzalez, who plays the role of&nbsp; Lidia Solis, in Gentefied. We will talk about Annie’s role on Gentefied, her boyfriend, net worth, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Annie Gonzalez On Gentefied</strong></h3><p>As we all know already, Annie portrays Lidia Solis, Erik Morales’ highly educated girlfriend.</p><p>Gentefied explores the diversity of Los Angeles’ Latinx community through the eyes of Erik, Ana, and Chris. Since she is the girlfriend of one of the main characters, her character too is equally important in the whole storyline.</p><p>When Annie’s character Lidia was introduced in Season 1, she was just a college graduate who had moved back home to Los Angeles with the hopes of creating a difference in her community. As time goes by, Lidia started dating Erik and soon they become girlfriend-boyfriend. Lidia also ended up pregnant with Erik’s child. In the 1st season itself, the two welcomed their daughter, Delfina.</p><p>Towards the end of Season 1 of Gentefied, Erik’s granddad Casimiro “Pop’ Morales, or the patriarch of the Morales family, was arrested. With Pop taken into custody by the ICE detention center, Erik and Lidia had to deal with the burdens of parenthood alone.</p><p>Although Pop is released from the ICE in Season 2 of Gentefied, their troubles do not get any less. Erik and Lidia move to Stanford for Lidia’s new job as a professor. It is while they are there, Erik and Lidia’s tension starts to rise. Though Lidia hires a new assistant, Diane, to help her with her job, she ends up stressing Lidia, even more, when Lidia finds out that Diane was blowing off her wok to smoke with Erik.</p><p>Finally, in the Thanksgiving episode of Gentefied, their tension explodes. Although the two have a huge fight, they happen to get a happy ending. At the end of Season 2, Erik proposes to Lidia, which she gleefully accepts.</p><h3><strong>Does Annie Gonzalez Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Annie Gonzalez does not talk about her dating life a lot on the Internet. That is why unfortunately we don’t have much information on her relationships.</p><p>Around 2013, Annie did tweet something about her boyfriend getting her the cutest sexy dress. On November 18, 2019, too, Annie took to Instagram to share a picture of herself and her boyfriend at the time, Gentry White. But, the two never got married and probably they are not together anymore.</p><p>At the present (2021), Annie appears to be single.</p><h3><strong>Annie Gonzalez Net Worth</strong></h3><p>As of 2021, Annie’s reported net worth is estimated to be around $300 thousand.</p><p>Annie Gonzalez began her career in the entertainment industry at the mere age of 10 when she became one of the original dancers JammX Kids for WB.</p><p>Her first popular TV role came in 2016 when she starred in the TV movie called Beauty School as Helga. Since then, Annie has landed roles in other popular TV shows as well, including FX’s American Horror Story, Showtime’s Shameless, Starz’s Vida, and Amazon’s Good Girls.</p><p>Annie was then cast in ABC’s comedy pilot Bucktown in the role of Jessie. Annie’s upcoming projects include Flamin’ Hot, The Edge of Her Mind Anthology: Her Movies Vol 1, and Once Upon a Time in Aztlan.</p><p>Represented by Grandson Des Rochers and Principal Entertainment Los Angeles, Annie Gonzalez signed with Innovative Artists as well.</p><h3><strong>Annie Gonzalez Measurements</strong></h3><p>Annie Gonzales stands at an average height of 5 feet 6 inches and weighs no more than 65 kilograms.

Apparently no longer the ‘done’ thing, she continued to tell me how unhealthy it is, citing an interview with biochemist Jessie Inchauspé (otherwise known as the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/glucosegoddess/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Glucose Goddess" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Glucose Goddess</a>) as evidence. Previously the most popular plant-based milk (in 2020, Brits spent £146 million on the stuff), oat milk has recently fallen out of favour as critics warn that it will raise your blood sugar unnecessarily.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the interview (that has garnered 4.5 million views on TikTok), Inchauspé tells author and entrepreneur Marie Forleo this: “oat milk comes from oats, oats are a grain, and grains are starch. So, when you’re drinking oat milk, you’re drinking starch juice. You’re drinking juice with a lot of glucose in it – so it leads to a big glucose spike.” She then goes on to say that whole milk and unsweetened nut milk are better options in terms of “glucose-balancing properties”, as they’re both low in starch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are several reasons why someone may choose to drink oat milk – veganism, sustainability, a nut / lactose allergy or intolerance are just a few. “Bearing in mind that 70 per cent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant, it’s important that we have alternatives,” says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theurbankitchen.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Toral Shah" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Toral Shah</a>, nutritional scientist and integrative medicine practitioner, who adds that oat milk is not a “bad” choice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There has been a lot of hype on social media recently around blood sugar ‘spikes’,” points out <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/sophiedietitian/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sophie Medlin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sophie Medlin</a>, consultant dietician. “In those without diabetes and prediabetes, this isn’t something we need to be concerned with as our body is able to easily maintain our blood sugars in a healthy range,” she continues. Outside the world of social media, health experts refer to these blood sugar changes as normal fluctuations in blood glucose – “it’s not something that we’re remotely concerned about as it’s just an example of the body regulating itself,” assures Medlin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, if blood sugar ‘spikes’ are not a cause for concern for those of us without diabetes and prediabetes, do we really need to ditch the oat milk lattes? And is oat milk actually worse for our health than cow’s milk or other plant-based alternatives? Here, we ask the experts to weigh in.</p><img alt="oat milk" title="Oat milk " width=2124 height=1416 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/oat-milk-in-glass-bottle-and-oatmeal-flakes-on-royalty-free-image-1707836841.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tanja Ivanova</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>How healthy is oat milk?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like everything in nutrition, the answer is nuanced. “Good quality oat milk can be part of a healthy diet, especially for those who can’t tolerate traditional dairy,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rhian Stephenson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rhian Stephenson</a>, nutritional therapist and founder of Artah Health, “but I wouldn’t call it a 'health food'.” The ingredients in oat milk can range from literally just oats and water to a list that includes added sugars, oils, preservatives and emulsifiers. “I would steer clear of the latter, which will be less healthy,” she advises.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When we’re using plant milks in place of dairy milk, Medlin says that it’s important to consider the nutritional implications. “For example, we know that those who don’t consume dairy, have worse bone density and higher fracture risk than those who do consume dairy. Additionally, dairy milk has always been a key source of iodine in our diets and without it, we can become iodine deficient which affects our thyroid function and fertility.” And while most people get plenty of protein in their wider diet, dairy milk is a source of protein that is lost when we switch to plant milks, especially when they’re made from grains like rice and oats rather than from nuts like almonds and cashews.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Responsible fortification of plant milks is key to ensure they’re a reasonable equivalent to dairy milk,” says Medlin. For the uninitiated, fortified means that it contains extra minerals and vitamins that are not naturally found in the plant-based alternative. “Look specifically for fortified oat milk,” seconds <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/drthivimaru/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Thivi Maruthappu" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Thivi Maruthappu</a>, consultant dermatologist, nutritionist and author of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/SkinFood-4-Step-Solution-Healthy-Happy/dp/0349432899 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=SkinFood data-vars-ga-product-id=7c90d6ca-cee7-44c2-9bb3-631b45e7f865 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/SkinFood-4-Step-Solution-Healthy-Happy/dp/0349432899 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/SkinFood-4-Step-Solution-Healthy-Happy/dp/0349432899 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/SkinFood-4-Step-Solution-Healthy-Happy/dp/0349432899 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"ae33d438-478d-4444-8c90-a5755782a57c","site_id":"73f36449-646d-480d-bdba-369f484c6984","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=400721e9-5a42-4d60-8d48-a201c9edb51c class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">SkinFood</a>, “as this is a good source of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D, calcium and B vitamins.”</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Does oat milk spike blood sugar?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Oat milk and other grain-based milks will have a slightly higher glycaemic index than dairy or nut milks – but the difference is insignificant in relation to a balanced diet,” says Medlin. Glycaemic index (GI) is a way of ranking carbohydrate-containing foods based on how quickly they affect your blood sugar level. For reference, oat milk has a GI of 60 while dairy milk has a GI of 37. “This means that oat milk has more readily available carbohydrate than dairy milk – but we also have to think about how oat milk is consumed to contextualise this,” continues Medlin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For example, “if you're having an oat latte, a glass of oat milk, or oat milk on cereal, then this is going to contribute to a spike in blood sugar – especially on an empty stomach,” says Stephenson. “But if you’re having it in tea, it will be a small amount and therefore not clinically significant and if you’re having it with high fibre cereal, the fibre in the cereal will impact the GI of the meal and make the oat milk component far less significant,” notes Medlin. To summarise, if you’re consuming a large quantity of oat milk without any fibre, fat or protein to combat it, then it will likely raise blood sugar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“People are too obsessed with spiking blood sugar levels,” says Shah. “Food is meant to spike blood sugar levels,” she continues. And, as Maruthappu points out, “for healthy adults, our body will lower blood sugar levels quickly and this is a physiological normal response.” The impact of oat milk on blood sugars is not of any concern to Medlin clinically. If it is, however, a concern for you – “try to have it after your meal instead of on an empty stomach, and choose a style of coffee with less milk, for instance a cortado vs a latte,” suggests Stephenson.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Which is better for you, oat milk or almond milk?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Almond milk contains around the same amount of protein and fibre as oat milk, so there isn’t a major difference nutritionally,” says Medlin. If someone is considering switching to a plant-based milk or needs to due to allergies, Medlin recommends opting for a fortified soya milk as it has a bit more protein than other plant milks. “Anything containing protein dampens that glucose spike because when you have more protein – blood sugar is released more slowly into your system,” explains Shah.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If we look at glycaemic index again as a way to measure how much something can impact our blood sugars, almond milk has a GI of 49 (a little less than oat milk’s 60). To compare it to other alt-milks, cashew milk has a GI of 53, coconut milk 97, hemp milk 60 and rice milk 98. “This means that oat milk is generally in the middle of the pack when it comes to how it affects our blood sugars,” says Medlin.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 10 foods that contain more sugar than you think" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hidden-sugars-1547644313.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Does oat milk have any nutritional value?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unless fortified with vitamins and minerals to make it more like dairy milk, oat milk has very little nutritional value. “We wouldn’t consider it a healthy or unhealthy food,” says Medlin, “unless it contains preservatives in which case, we would consider it an ultra-processed food and not healthy.” It has about 0.8g of fibre and 1.1g of protein per 100ml which means it can’t be classed as a source of either in a diet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some brands of oat milk may contain oils such as sunflower oil or rapeseed oil. “These oils act as an emulsifier, so they keep the water from separating in the drink and contribute to a creamier texture,” explains Stephenson, who adds that “commercial seed oils are deodorised during processing, which can increase trans-fats in the end products.” According to Medlin and Maruthappu, these oils are not harmful to health when consumed in moderation.</p><img alt=Coffee title=Coffee width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/21/1464105077-coffee.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Do you need to ditch oat milk?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The claims surrounding oat milk on social media are hugely inflated and if you’re going to drink a plant-based alternative, oat milk is as good a choice as any,” reassures Medlin. The key is to make sure that it’s fortified and doesn’t contain emulsifiers and preservatives. “Always check the labels,” advises Stephenson. “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plenish-Organic-Unsweetened-Milk-Litre/dp/B09WZKHZMJ/ref=asc_df_B09WZKHZMJ/" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Plenish data-vars-ga-product-id=8498c274-4fbe-44c1-a2d3-ec21f84777bd data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plenish-Organic-Unsweetened-Milk-Litre/dp/B09WZKHZMJ/ref=asc_df_B09WZKHZMJ/" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plenish-Organic-Unsweetened-Milk-Litre/dp/B09WZKHZMJ/ref=asc_df_B09WZKHZMJ/" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plenish-Organic-Unsweetened-Milk-Litre/dp/B09WZKHZMJ/ref=asc_df_B09WZKHZMJ/" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"ae33d438-478d-4444-8c90-a5755782a57c","site_id":"73f36449-646d-480d-bdba-369f484c6984","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=c148a19b-e45c-40cb-9246-31ab87ea0a10 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Plenish</a>, for example, uses gluten-free organic oats, water, and sea salt. In my opinion, this is the best quality oat milk on the market right now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is, however, a trade off, “because it is free from emulsifiers and oils, it's not going to give you as much froth or the same creamy consistency as other barista brands,” says Stephenson, “but it is going to be better for your health”. Top tip? If you froth your own milk at home, “add a dash of olive oil as it will give you that same creamy consistency, plus it’s a really good way of getting a little bit of omega-3 and 6,” suggests Shah.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you are consuming a lot of oat milk, especially on an empty stomach, consider reducing your daily intake (swapping out a latte for a flat white or cortado) and having oat milk alongside or after a protein-packed meal, says Maruthappu. “Personally, I still have oat milk in my daily coffee, but I have it after lunch, using a good quality oat milk,” says Stephenson. “It's not a lot, and in the context of my overall diet, it's not something I'm personally concerned about.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX5u2tbrErKpmr5WhuaOxyKeeaJlka4R3g5VtZ2inkal6rrXLpGSdnZKWwaZ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffitness-wellbeing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffitness-wellbeing.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffitness-wellbeing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffitness-wellbeing.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffitness-wellbeing.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffitness-wellbeing.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-durrells-location-filming-corfu-greece-latest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-durrells-location-filming-corfu-greece-latest.html>Find out where The Durrells was filmed - and what the cast got up to on their days off</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./upgrade-kernel-linux-mint.html>Do a Kernel Upgrade the Easy Way in Linux Mint</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./upgrade-kernel-linux-mint.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

The Internet and social media have brought a number of these talented people to us regardless of distance or location. The British-South African YouTube personality, Caspar Richard George Lee, better known as Caspar Lee, has taken advantage of these fronts, particularly the video-sharing website YouTube, to an extent that we can only admire.</p><p>He is also a vlogger, actor, and entrepreneur and is considered one of the best British YouTubers with his channel, which will rank 243rd among the most subscribed channels from 2017. Due to his success in the video-sharing industry, he was named by Yahoo! News in December 2013 as one of 12 web-savvy entrepreneurs to watch.</p><p>Learn more about this web-savvy personality.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Ashley Benson Bio, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Relationships and Affairs</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Caspar Lee Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>YouTuber, Casper Lee was born in Paddington London on 24 April 1994. After his birth, his mother brought him to South Africa where he lived with his family, his parents, and his older sister Theodora. When he was six years old, he was diagnosed with Tourettes Syndrome – a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotypical, involuntary movements, and vocalizations called tics.</p><p>During his stay in South Africa, his family moved to different parts of the country where he had the opportunity to experience many facets of life and learn some life-long lessons. First, he went to a rural area called Fort Nottingham and then to Durban, South Africa, where he attended an all-boys school, Crawford College, La Lucia.</p><p>At the age of 11, he had to move again to the Western Cape where he learned to play tennis. He also attended Oakhill High School in Knysna. A few years later his parents, Emily Riordan Lee and Jonathan Lee, divorced, which does not bode well for him, but he was able to build a strong relationship with his parents afterward.</p><p>Caspar started his YouTube channel in 2011 under the name Dicasp (Director Caspar) but was later renamed, Caspar. His channel quickly became quite popular and he started working with other famous YouTube personalities such as Joe Sugg (with whom he later shared an apartment), Jacks’s Gap, Sam Pepper, Marcus Butler, and others. The collaboration helped to increase the number of his subscribers to the point where it became a career. He even launched another channel, morecaspar, where he uploads funny vlogs.</p><p>However, he started migrating again and in December 2012 moved back to his birthplace, London, England, where he lived with Alfie Deyes, a YouTuber colleague, until 2014. Shortly thereafter, he moved in with another YouTuber friend, Joe Sugg (ThatcherJoe), when his former roommate moved in with his girlfriend Zoe Sugg aka Zoella (Joe’s sister who lived with him). He stayed with Joe until February 2016, when he moved into a shared apartment with Josh Pieters, also a YouTube.</p><p>The shared apartment gives him the opportunity to work with the best YouTubers on a daily basis.</p><p>Apart from his YouTube career, Caspar has also appeared in several films. He played the character of garlic in the comedy Spud 3: Learning to Fly, which a seagull sang in the British version of the 2015 film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. Caspar Lee also appeared alongside his friend Joe in the 2015 travel documentary Joe and Caspar Hit the Road and the sequel Joe and Caspar Hit the Road: USA. The documentary was produced for BBC Worldwide. In 2016 he was cast with YouTuber KSI in Laid in America and can be seen in the music video for the 2017 Charli XCX Single Boys.</p><p>In the YouTube community, he has collaborated with other personalities on a number of projects. He was part of the YouTube boyband that raised money for Comic Relief in 2014. Along with a number of other YouTubers, he starred in the 2014 Style Haul series The Crew and was featured in an episode of the 2014 American television series Web Therapy. In addition to publishing vlogs, pranks, and competition videos, he has a series of videos in which he interviews celebrities in a funny way. These celebrities include Liam Payne, Zac Efron, Channing Tatum, and Finn Harries.</p><p>Caspar, a man with many hats, has also written a book, his autograph, Caspar Lee with his mother. The book was published in May 2016. In 2017 he became Chief Innovation Officer of Influencer Ltd, a British agency for influence marketing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong class=amp-wp-inline-90059db4e6dc6e5f8d2c6b6d53dc3649>His Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Caspar is considered one of the best UK YouTubers with over 7.5 million subscribers and over 850 million video views. His second channel has almost 2 million subscribers and more than 116 million video views.</p><p>If you look at the fame of his channel and the number of views he has achieved without talking about the subscribers who are connected to him, the YouTuber earns a lot of money for itself. Its net worth is estimated at around 800,000 to 3 million dollars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Caspar Lee Gay or does He have a Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Fame and good looks don’t usually leave you unattached, or rather, single. Caspar, the South African sweetheart, has been associated with a number of pretty girls over the course of his career, either as pure speculation or as true, but still short-lived.</p><p>First, it was the Friday singer Rebecca Black in 2013, then Lauren Elizabeth later that year (the duo appeared in each other’s videos and supposedly spent some time together), Alexa Losey, Gaby Jones (with whom he actually dated from October 2013 to 2014) and Emma Laven. The role of Maisie Williams, the heir to the throne, with whom he has been dating since 2014 and whom he even showed in his video “Bedroom Advice”, is also on the list.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Catherine Bell Measurements, Age, Daughter, Family, Where Is She Today?</a></strong></p><p>However, he started dating model Madeleine (Maddie) Thea, whom he met on Tinder in 2016. In a Twitter post in 2017, he announced that they are no longer together.</p><p>With a whole series of Caspar’s probable and actual girlfriends, there is then no longer any doubt about his sexual orientation. In any case, he is heterosexual.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and Other Facts</strong></h2><ul><li>Caspar Lee is not only good-looking but also has a good height. He is 1.89 m tall (6′ 2″).</li><li>He has received recognition for his achievements on YouTube and in films. In 2015 he was nominated for the Nickelodeon Children’s Choice Award for the UK’s favorite blogger but lost to Zoella.</li><li>One of his most famous videos, Girlfriends Pranks My Roommate, has been viewed over 20 million times.</li><li>He is also an entrepreneur and has his own clothing line.</li><li>He helped actress Maisie Williams start her own YouTube channel.</li><li>Caspar proved that he has some other sides to his personality, the humanitarian side that wants to give something back to society. He offered a full scholarship to a student, Indiphile Wootboi, at the school he attended in South Africa, in Oakhill.</li><li>His fame is not limited to YouTube, he is also a star on Instagram and Twitter with over 6.1 million followers on Twitter and over 3.6 million on Instagram.</li><li>When he talked about his disease, Tourette’s syndrome, in a YouTube video, he explained that he has an itch that you can’t scratch and it gets worse and worse until it is scratched.</li><li>His favorite food is pizza and his favorite day of the week is Friday.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKK%2Fz5qpZqSVmnq4tcqiZJqflWK1prXGoatmppWperi70a2fZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lmah6qbGMoJiyZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcaspar-lee-wiki-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-is-he-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcaspar-lee-wiki-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-is-he-gay.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcaspar-lee-wiki-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-is-he-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcaspar-lee-wiki-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-is-he-gay.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcaspar-lee-wiki-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-is-he-gay.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcaspar-lee-wiki-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-is-he-gay.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daniel-boulud.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daniel-boulud.html>Daniel Boulud</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./546248-bible-verses-flowers-gardens-natures-beauty.html>25+ Bible verses about flowers, gardens, and nature's beauty</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./546248-bible-verses-flowers-gardens-natures-beauty.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

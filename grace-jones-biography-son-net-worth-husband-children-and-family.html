We will feel your pulse but wait for it because you will have all your questions answered as you read through. Grace Jones is a model that would not fit into your everyday description of a model, but she checks all the boxes, which makes it right for her.</p><p>She is also a singer and actress of Jamaican origin who has released several hot and popular singles and has landed some big movie roles in Hollywood. Her charisma and personality stand out from the crowd and she is a being that the American showbiz industry will not soon forget. We’d like to take a look at what makes her fat and what gave her career the boost that has brought her to where she is today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Grace Jones’ Biography</strong></h2><p>Grace Jones is the third child of Robert W. Jones and Marjorie Williams. She was born into the family on May 19, 1948, in Spanish Town, Jamaica. Of her siblings (who were six years old in total) Bishop Noel Joel and Chris Jones are the most popular. Her father, Robert, was involved in local politics and was also a preacher who identified with the apostolic denomination. Their mother, on the other hand, was an athlete who was prevented from participating in an Olympic event because of her faith.</p><p>The couple left Jamaica and moved (without their children) to the United States in search of better opportunities. Meanwhile, Grace and her siblings stayed with their maternal grandmother and her husband, who was a strict disciplinary officer. Since Jones was of the Pentecostal faith, she began attending the All Saints Pentecostal school, but not long after that she was withdrawn and sent to a public school near her home. She picked up where her mother had left off in sports, and distinguished herself as an athlete, although she was harassed because of her lean stature at the time.</p><p>At the age of 13, she (and her siblings) moved to the USA to live with her parents and continued her education at Onondaga Community College. By this time she had become a rebel at home and did whatever she wanted, including moving out to live in another city – Philadelphia – where she was involved with drugs.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Lupe Fiasco Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Other Facts</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>She was hired as a model by the New York talent agency Wilhelmina Models. Her selling point seemed foreign to the US modeling arena, so Grace Jones moved to Paris, France in 1970, where she felt more at home in the modeling industry. She had her first jobs on the catwalk for high-end clients like Claude Montana and Yves St. Laurent. She also worked with Guy Bourdin, Hans Feurer, and Helmut Newton and appeared on the covers of top magazines such as En Vogue, Stern, and Elle.</p><p>In 1974 she took up her musical talents and was signed to Island Records. Her first album was released three years later, in 1977, under the title “Portfolio” on Island Records. It was followed by “Fame”, which became a big hit. However, the album that made her famous was “Nightclubbing”, which was released in 1981 and was awarded platinum and gold. And although other albums like “Living My Life”, “Slave To The Rhythm”, “Inside Story” etc. followed, the album “Nightclubbing” is still considered her best studio achievement.</p><p>She did not shy away from any adventure and slipped into some acting roles that turned out well. Jones made her debut in 1973 with the movie Gordon’s War, in which she played the role of Mary. She played in Conan the Destroyer (1984) as Zula the Amazon and as Max Zorin’s henchman in the Agent 007 James Bond series A View to a Kill (1985). Her other films include Straight to Hell (1987), Cyber Bandits (1995), Wolf Girl (2001), No Place Like Home (2006), Gutter Dawn (2016), etc.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Grace Jones Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Grace Jones has enriched every aspect of show business and has been successful in all areas. From modeling to music to acting on screen, she has never let her background stop her from being the best in all her endeavors. Her versatility in the entertainment industry has also brought financial rewards. Her net worth is estimated at $7 million, which makes her a super luxurious lifestyle possible.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family: Son, Husband, and Children</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_36857 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36857></figure><p>This controversial diva has been through two marriages, both of which ended in separations (even though she claims to have been married only once). She had her first known relationship with the French photographer Jean-Paul Goude, whom she met in 1977. The relationship developed from a professional to a romantic one, and in November 1979 a child was born. The next relationship she had was with the Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren, who was her bodyguard at the time they were together. They dated for three years (1983-1986) before they went their separate ways.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>David Harbour Height, Age, Married, Wife, Dating, Girlfriend, Is He Gay?</a></strong></p><p>In 1986 there was also the actor Chris Makepeace and the film producer Chris Stanley, to whom she denies ever having been married, although the records say otherwise. The marriage she acknowledges is that with Atila Altaunbay, a Muslim from Turkey who was her bodyguard. After he held a knife to her throat out of jealousy, this was the end of the marriage, although they were never officially divorced (because she never believed in it). Among her other known affairs are the Danish actor Sven-Ole Thorsen, the music producer Ivor Guest, the renowned director Quentin Tarantino and so on.</p><p>Paulo Goude is the only son of the legendary singer and actress she had with her French ex-partner, Jean-Paul Goude. Paulo Goude came after his mother and is a musician and singer. He is a member of the band Trybez and has performed on his mother’s tours. He is a father and shares his lovely daughter with his girlfriend Azella, who happens to be a member of this band.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Grace Jones</strong></h2><p><strong>Name:</strong>&nbsp;Grace Jones</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong>&nbsp;Model, actor, singer</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong>&nbsp;May 19, 1948</p><p><strong>Birth:</strong>&nbsp;Spanish Town, Jamaica</p><p><strong>Nationality:</strong>&nbsp;Jamaican</p><p><strong>Marital Status:</strong>&nbsp;Divorcee</p><p><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong>&nbsp;Gemini</p><p><strong>Height:</strong>&nbsp;5 feet 8 inches (173 cm)</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;121 lb (55 kg)</p><p><strong>Hair Color:</strong>&nbsp;Black</p><p><strong>Eye Color:</strong>&nbsp;Dark brown</p><p><strong>Net Worth:</strong>&nbsp;$7 million</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktLOtwp5ko6eemsBursionquZoJ3Gbr%2FOp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fkoa2jl66vsIycn6KklKeyr3nAp5tmnpGitq3Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgrace-jones-biography-son-net-worth-husband-children-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgrace-jones-biography-son-net-worth-husband-children-and-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgrace-jones-biography-son-net-worth-husband-children-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgrace-jones-biography-son-net-worth-husband-children-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgrace-jones-biography-son-net-worth-husband-children-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgrace-jones-biography-son-net-worth-husband-children-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./133804.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./133804.html>Otis Redding III, Son Of The Soul Icon Otis Redding, Dead at 59</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./584e626b268e3e3e7d8b4637-html.html>Gadgets que mejoran el sonido</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./584e626b268e3e3e7d8b4637-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

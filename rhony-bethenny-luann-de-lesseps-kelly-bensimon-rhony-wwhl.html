Bethenny called Luann "insufferable" and "sick" before she accused her of never checking in on her following the overdose and death of her boyfriend, Dennis Shields. Bethenny spearheaded Luann's intervention last year, which only exacerbated her feelings on the matter. She also felt Luann was "dining out" on her sobriety.</p><p>Once Bethenny caught her breath and was able to process what had just happened, she was instantly flooded with remorse and apologized to Lu. De Lesseps apologized, too, but during a later confessional, she said, "Okay! I'm sorry! I give up! Will you take your foot off my hand now?"</p><p>On Thursday, Bethenny grimaced at the comment, telling Andy, "Eeeee, ya know? Like, that's what she said."</p><p>"It was an explosion and a reaction to many things, obviously. No one acts like that in any restaurant, no matter what's happened," Bethenny continued. "There was a boiling point. But there was really something that I was observing in her that just really triggered me. And I mean, you've seen it before with her with me. There's something that happens, where I'm like, 'Why are you saying that you invented the Skinnygirl Margarita?!'"</p><p>"I had had it, and I had been absorbing what everyone had been saying," Bethenny went on. "And I guess because of the time I spent before the previous reunion, spending three days, instead of just resting, outside of her house. I literally had two lawyers on a Sunday come to her house, and Dennis was thinking of bailing her out of her <strong><a href=#>$6 million situation</a></strong>. So I went all in. I got her rehab paid for. So I just felt like, 'What the hell are you doing?! Who are you?! Like, how are you so not self-aware?!'"</p><p>"And even right after that moment," B continued, "she was like, 'Well, I've been going through a lot.' I don't wanna be like, 'I've been going through a lot,' but I've been through a little bit this year. So that's what happened. I popped off. It seems like people understand it. I felt terrible about it... I felt really just unhinged, but everyone got it. And thank you for all getting it. I don't wanna act like that."</p><p>Despite her remorse, Bethenny did feel "it was time" Lu hear what everyone had been thinking.</p><p>"You could be fed anything -- pizza, chocolate, cabaret -- to the point where you throw up," she said. "You know how they force-feed those geese for the foie gras? Then you throw it up! So I threw up all over Luann. I threw Luann up all over Luann."</p><p>Bethenny also revealed she's since removed herself from Luann's sobriety journey and legal issues, but would intervene again if need be.</p><p>"I don't even know what's going on, really," Bethenny explained to an inquiring caller. "She's shooting videos and doing her cabaret, so she seems fine. And I'm out, but I'd do it again if something really bad happened because I would do that for anybody, but I like this distance from this situation."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:af6a0798-1a2f-502a-8d53-00d1173759d7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc695dcf-11b2-5950-ab9e-cebe80126226 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5b/5by4/2019/06/21/5bfd6065f7f150b794db4ee475d60f9d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bethenny Frankel Says Sunny Hostin Must Be 'Been Drinking or Taking Some Drugs' After 'View' Host's Slam</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>On Kelly's Incendiary Podcast Interview</h2><p>Andy asked Bethenny if she had any response to her <strong><a href=#>former "RHONY" co-star's claims</a></strong> that B didn't "care" about the well-being of her unborn baby during their Season 3 cast trip to the Virgin Islands, otherwise known as "Scary Island." Bensimon also implied Bethenny faked all the scenes that showed her traveling to and from Los Angeles to visit her dying father. Kelly then said Andy hated her because he was jealous of her successes.</p><p>"I mean, if you wanna take a look at insanity, listen to that [interview]. Don't read it 'cause <strong><a href=#>Dorinda [Medley]</a></strong> said, 'I listened to it, and it's like watching Scary Island,'" Bethenny told Andy. "So I'm gonna promote these people that are sitting there trying to act normal while she's like, 'No, I'm like real. I live and am. I'm real. And Andy hates me because I was on Shape magazine and I have leggings.' I mean, if you want an indication of Scary Island, this is Scarier Island."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a91a3b2a-bab7-5f16-89a1-c6d01efbdf21 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc695dcf-11b2-5950-ab9e-cebe80126226 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/09/5by4/2019/06/20/098a78c373655d8a9b946f52d57a50d0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHONY' Recap: Bethenny and Luann Face Aftermath of Miami Blowout, Tinsley Vows to Freeze Dead Dog</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>On Rumors Tinsley Is Dating Billy Bush</h2><p>This season, viewers saw Tinsley break up with her longtime boyfriend, Scott, who was having issues committing to the socialite. She's recently been spotted hanging out with radio host <strong><a href=#>Billy Bush</a></strong>, but Bethenny doesn't think it's anything more than a PR stunt.</p><p>"I think that that was a little bit of a PR thing," she told an inquiring caller. "I don't think that they were really together hanging out, probably just a little flirt. He's a canoodler and so is she, so there was a little flirt."</p><p>The caller also asked Bethenny if she thought Tinsley had "an agreement with Scott," which comes off the heels of Dorinda questioning why Tinsley's affluent lifestyle didn't change after the two parted ways.</p><p>"I don't know about like a deal with Scott. I don't think that she had a deal with Scott," Bethenny explained. "I think that it's been back and forth and up and down, and I think she has more of a gag order from Scott."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1f86c0a1-575d-5f40-ab31-c881ea1ef884 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc695dcf-11b2-5950-ab9e-cebe80126226 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fa/5by4/2019/06/13/faae021f6a28569aa989112b0a7764a0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Anthony Scaramucci's Wife Deidre Ball 'Would Love' to Join 'The Real Housewives of New York' -- And So Would He</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>On Ramona's Makeout Sesh with Harry Dubin</h2><p>Another caller asked Bethenny if she felt <strong><a href=#>Ramona Singer</a></strong> had broken "girl code" by making out with <strong><a href=#>Harry Dubin</a></strong> this season, and Bethenny's answer did not disappoint.</p><p>"Whose girl code?

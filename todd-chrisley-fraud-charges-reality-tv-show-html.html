As a result, the <a href=#>family’s reality-TV shows, podcasts, and other projects have reportedly been canceled</a>.<br>Original story follows.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4sp7p76000i16oiotoxtqws@published data-word-count=44>On the <a href=#>June 23 episode of Chrisley Knows Best</a>, the Chrisley family acted out its usual 1950s-television-family shtick by spending the afternoon refiling spice jars in the kitchen. The family patriarch, Todd, barreled in with a big announcement: He was joining a gardening club.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgagg00193e6k4zz22liu@published data-word-count=11>“What do you know about gardening?” his 24-year-old daughter, Savannah, asked.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svganu001b3e6k7kkoz92q@published data-word-count=6>“Nothing,” his wife, Julie, 49, said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgauk001c3e6kh7cp2p6e@published data-word-count=41>“I have no desire to be a gardener, but I do have a new real-estate company opening up in the next three weeks, and one of the biggest developers in Nashville is a member of the Garden Society,” Todd, 53, replied.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgaz2001d3e6kcsihw3ak@published data-word-count=12>“Money, money, money!” Todd’s 78-year-old mother, Nanny Faye, chanted, snapping her fingers.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgb81001e3e6kn0igj6jf@published data-word-count=69>Todd, Julie, and Savannah all laughed. The episode (the premiere episode of the second half of the ninth season of the USA show) was the first new one to air since Todd and Julie’s conviction on federal fraud and tax-evasion charges. The couple are facing 30-year sentences and potentially millions in fines for running an elaborate scheme to defraud the government. No one in the family is laughing anymore.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgbci001f3e6kpsl08plx@published data-word-count=74>The Chrisleys broke their silence on the charges on their podcast, <a href=#>Chrisley Confessions</a>, which aired Wednesday, and shared that they are going through a very tough time in their lives. “It’s a very sad, heartbreaking time for our family right now,” Todd said. “We still hold steadfast to our faith, and we trust God will do what he does best, because God is a miracle worker and that’s what we are holding out for.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgbgt001g3e6k4r9gt9yb@published data-word-count=32>“We are alive and kicking,” Julie said. She also thanked fans who have apparently been driving up to eight hours to drop off flowers or meals for them on their Nashville doorstep.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgbkz001h3e6kiu44z04l@published data-word-count=166>The TV episode, titled “No Basic B*tch,” was filmed before their conviction was handed down and before their grueling three-week trial in which they were <a href=#>both found guilty</a> of “conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million of fraudulent loans” and “conspiring to defraud the IRS.” But with their reality show being picked up for another season, legal experts wonder how this searing taste of actual reality will affect the family’s “reality show.” It’s not just the Chrisley Knows Best show that’s on the line. A month before their guilty verdict,<a href=#> E! Network announced </a>“a trifecta” for the “outrageously charming Southern family,” attaching their names to three shows — E! greenlit a dating series called Love Limo that will be hosted and executive-produced by Todd, and the network picked up a fourth season of Growing Up Chrisley, which focuses on the lives of Savannah and her brother Chase, 26. Chrisley Knows Best was also picked up for a tenth season by USA Network.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgbpe001i3e6kdu9bxvux@published data-word-count=21>Here, everything you need to know about how this close-knit family of scammers/charmers ended up in a situation stickier than molasses.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4svhd7k002a3e6k033ap37u@published>Who are the Chrisleys, and where did their money come from?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgc22001k3e6kpxms16wf@published data-word-count=108>The Chrisley-family show first aired in 2014 as a reality take on the 1950s sitcom Father Knows Best. <a href=#>Todd, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, was touted as self-made multimillionaire real-estate developer</a> along with his “doting wife Julie, headstrong children Chase, Savannah, and Grayson, adorable granddaughter Chloe, and Todd’s mother, Nanny Faye.” They began sharing their lives with viewers when they lived in Atlanta and continued when the family moved to Nashville in 2019 and upgraded at the time to a <a href=#>$3.4 million mansion.</a> (They put that house on the market two months after pleading not guilty to the federal charges and downsized to a <a href=#>smaller, 11,053-square-foot</a> home.)</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl4svhxnk002y3e6kcmc2um5r@published>Why did these southern charmers end up in trouble with the Feds?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgcaf001m3e6kkj5bxh44@published data-word-count=53>“I make millions of dollars a year, but we still have the same issues that parents who are making $40,000 a year have,” Todd said in a 2013 episode of the show, according to court papers.. He further claimed that “in a year, we probably spend over $300,000, sometimes more, just on clothing.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgcdl001n3e6k5bh0eegm@published data-word-count=113>The family was portrayed as just your regular, down-to-earth millionaires next door. The problem was it wasn’t just guilty-pleasure viewers tuning in each week to see the Chrisleys’ latest antics. Agents from the IRS and the Department of Justice were also watching. After Todd and Julie spent more than $7,000 at an electronics store, $2,000 at a luxury retail store, and thousands of dollars at department and clothing stores, Todd told an IRS officer that he didn’t have money to pay his 2009 tax bill. The agents took notice, according to court papers. IRS officials also realized that Todd failed to file timely tax returns or pay income tax from 2013 through 2016.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgch0001o3e6kwyyb71py@published data-word-count=112>None of that sat well with the IRS. Todd and Julie, along with their accountant, were indicted by a grand jury in 2019. The DOJ criminal indictment alleged that despite the fact that Todd and Julie were paid millions of dollars for their appearances on the reality show, they failed to file federal tax returns or submit timely payments to the IRS for four years. It took three years before the Chrisleys were brought to court. After the three-week federal trial, which ended on June 7, they were found guilty of the charges against them and are now facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in jail plus potentially millions in fines.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Todd Chrisley (@toddchrisley)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl4svgclm001p3e6ka47s4vol@published data-word-count=93>“The Chrisleys, with the help of their former business partner, submitted false bank statements, audit reports, and personal financial statements to banks to obtain millions of dollars in fraudulent loans,” according to a statement released after the trial <a href=#>by the Department of Justice.</a> “The Chrisleys then spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel — and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones.

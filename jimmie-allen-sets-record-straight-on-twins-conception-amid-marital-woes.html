"I've known Danielle for years. Way before I became 'Jimmie Allen.' And at the time that she got pregnant with the twins, I wasn't with Lexi, and [Danielle] wasn't with her husband."</p><p>The "Down Home" singer continued, "But it's interesting just watching how life happens whether you plan it or whether you're ready for it or not. So Danielle was pregnant first, because me and Lexi weren't together when Danielle got pregnant."</p><p>"Twins were born first," he made clear. "Then me and Lexi decided we wanted to try to work on [our relationship]."</p><p>Things were made all the more complicated as Gale then got pregnant with the pair's third child. While the twins were born in the summer, Alexis gave birth to her and Allen's son Cohen in September.</p><p>Allen said that when he shared the news of his twins' birth on Instagram, things got "misconstrued."</p><p>"These articles come out, 'Jimmie Allen Gets Married Superfan Pregnant.' That couldn't be farther from the truth," Allen maintained. "She's not a superfan. She's a friend. And she wasn't with her husband and I wasn't with my wife."</p><p>"I am healing and growing for me and my children," he continued.</p><p>While he and Gale attempted to fix their marriage, Allen told Gifford that deep down, he knew it was over.</p><p>"Why? If I know that I don't want to be in a relationship and I don't want to be married and I know that she's not the person for me, and I'm not the person for her, why would I do that again to her?" he said of reconciling with Gale. "Why would I do that again to myself? It's gotta be right."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d09ce606-62c0-4c7f-a744-1e0949609881 data-container-ref=toofab:article:51687a60-12a6-4f97-ab42-ac8d19e98cbd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e7/5by4/2021/11/24/e7af457c4c6443918b1a4673f289ee3e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jimmie Allen Gives Update on Newborn Daughter After She 'Stopped Breathing'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Allen admitted to cheating on Gale, something he said he rationalized in the moment before coming to the realization that he had done his wife wrong.</p><p>"For the longest time in my head I remember thinking, 'OK well as long as I'm providing for my wife and for my children I'm good. I have the freedom to do whatever I want,'" Allen explained. "And that's not the right mentality. Itâ€™s wrong. I made a commitment, and I should've either stuck with it or ended it. I cheated on her multiple times. She knew about it."</p><p>In addition to the infidelities that were present throughout their marriage, there were also allegations of sexual assault leveled against Allen. While the case has since been dropped, the Delaware-born musician said he was "heartbroken" and felt betrayed by the woman who was suing him, whom he thought "cared" about him.</p><p>"Looking at it now, I would totally do everything different," Allen said. "Biggest change I would've made -- personally -- I wouldn't have gotten married. Or if I did, I felt like I would be honest about who I am, and the type of relationship I want."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1ff424a7-c602-4faf-882c-cdce0419ee1e data-container-ref=toofab:article:51687a60-12a6-4f97-ab42-ac8d19e98cbd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2024/04/22/7fa6b9a505b245ce9ef45d9b49cb5ffe_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Scheana Shay Explodes on Tom Sandoval for Weaponizing Her Past Affair on Vanderpump Rules</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Allen ultimately admitted that he wasn't ready for marriage when he and Gale tied the knot in 2020, and again in 2021, but felt pressured by people around him to do what he "should do."</p><p>"When I got married, I knew I wasn't ready to be a husband," Allen said. "But I was at this point in my life where it felt like I should do that because I heard constantly, 'You should be married, you should be this.'"</p><p>He and Gale are still in the process of divorcing, despite reconciling in October.</p><p>In addition to son Cohen, the former spouses are also parents to daughters Naomi, 4, and Zara, 2. Allen is also dad to son Aadyn, 9, from a previous relationship.</p><a id=gallery-link-5b45e6aa-b10b-4638-8410-fc1339f85aac class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5b45e6aa-b10b-4638-8410-fc1339f85aac data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:51687a60-12a6-4f97-ab42-ac8d19e98cbd data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1d/4by3/2021/11/24/1d53e9808755490c9f015139a7f7764f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma25fn7auucieZJqknJq7br%2FErapmqpWYvLOwjKyrq5mZnLW1ec6nZK2vmaPAbq%2FOp5qeqKSevK95wKagnWWdlr%2BqwMClZLCnlah8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmie-allen-sets-record-straight-on-twins-conception-amid-marital-woes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjimmie-allen-sets-record-straight-on-twins-conception-amid-marital-woes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjimmie-allen-sets-record-straight-on-twins-conception-amid-marital-woes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjimmie-allen-sets-record-straight-on-twins-conception-amid-marital-woes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmie-allen-sets-record-straight-on-twins-conception-amid-marital-woes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmie-allen-sets-record-straight-on-twins-conception-amid-marital-woes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chiefs-dolphins-nfl-fans-nbc-peacock-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chiefs-dolphins-nfl-fans-nbc-peacock-html.html>Sarcastic NFL fans mock NBC for charging them a monthly fee just to watch Chiefs-Dolphins on Peacock</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ilana-kloss-bio-age-height-and-facts-about-billie-jean-kings-partner.html>Ilana Kloss Bio, Age, Height And Facts About Billie Jean Kings Partner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ilana-kloss-bio-age-height-and-facts-about-billie-jean-kings-partner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

And she said that they were heading to an afterparty at TomTom. And during that car ride there was an altercation between two people in the car, which made her and Teddi have to get out of the car," Shay recalled. "They had to separate the two individuals in the car. And [they] further suggested that James was involved, and now there's rumors flying around that Teddi might have hinted at an altercation between you and James."</p><p>Lewber was quick to shut down an implication of abuse, telling Shay, "that never happened."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8c0a08df-9f82-433e-add1-4bd7b12e2f53 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6e538c0e-70c9-4abd-b44b-1f0de8e40c4a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2d/5by4/2024/02/09/2de8a3147bdf4cd4a367b4c31d8f1de3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ariana Madix Says Tom Sandoval 'Wont Get S--t' from Her After He Says She Doesn't Pay Any Bills</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"That's crazy to me that that's the most asked question [for me]. That makes me really sad, because no, I'm good. That never happened. There was no physical altercation," Lewber said. "Yes, we were in the car together. I thought we were having fun. We were having fun. But then James and I did get into an argument, but there was no physical assault. I was not bleeding, and they didn't have to get out of the car and separate us. So that didn't happen. That's all I'll say on that."</p><p>Lewber did admit, however, that they were drinking that night -- fans of the show will recall that Kennedy, who announced during the season 11 premiere that he's back to being sober, has struggled with alcohol.</p><p>"He was still drinking. Yeah, we were all drunk in the back of that car. Yeah, that's true," she said. "But nothing happened physically. I mean, we went to TomTom. We showed up at TomTom and we had fun. It was, like, a good night. I don't think that that was, like, the moment or, like, the night when we were like, 'OK, drinking is not great.'"</p><p>Lewber continued, "We would fight when we would drink. I would drink and pick [fights]. When you drink that much and in those environments, it is not great. That's not who we really are. That's an example of why he shouldn't drink."</p><p>Despite the sometimes rocky moments that occur when the pair are under the influence, Lewber said that she and Kennedy are doing well, and that the DJ is "working on himself."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:622b75fc-dd38-4dfa-a65d-6918ad42e078 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6e538c0e-70c9-4abd-b44b-1f0de8e40c4a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ac/5by4/2024/02/07/acd1049157234e1087aa5d18cf68837c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Scheana Shay Breaks Down After Brock Davies Brings Up Her Postpartum OCD Struggles</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"We're good. We're happy. He's working on himself. I know in the past that he has anger issues. So I get it," Lewber admitted. "But I just want people to know that I'm good and I'm safe and I love him."</p><p>After claiming that Kennedy's ex-girlfriends, <a href=#><strong>Rachel Leviss</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>, have implied that there might have been alleged physical abuse during their relationships with the reality star, Shay said she wanted to give Lewber a "safe space" to speak about "anything," should she feel so inclined.</p><p>The astrologer thanked Shay and again assured VPR fans that she's all good.</p><p>"Thank you. Because I didn't know," Lewber said in response. "I'm like, do I go on my Instagram to say, 'I'm good, guys?' Like, I don't know how to navigate these types of things. And this is something thatâ€™s very serious. And I do appreciate everyone worried about me. But I do want everyone to know I'm good."</p><a id=gallery-link-92ddbedc-6f25-4503-8d0a-fe7f57e22457 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:92ddbedc-6f25-4503-8d0a-fe7f57e22457 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6e538c0e-70c9-4abd-b44b-1f0de8e40c4a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/95/4by3/2024/01/18/95bfc95d84c44b92ad6ff649dd00f1a9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmampfq66vsMSrp66loGK%2FtrjErGSapJyueq2x1pucq2WUmruqsdJmoZqllah6rLHNp5ydsV2Wr7a%2FxGaYpaSVnK61tc6nqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvanderpump-rules-ally-lewber-denies-james-kennedy-abuse-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvanderpump-rules-ally-lewber-denies-james-kennedy-abuse-allegations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-ally-lewber-denies-james-kennedy-abuse-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvanderpump-rules-ally-lewber-denies-james-kennedy-abuse-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-ally-lewber-denies-james-kennedy-abuse-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-ally-lewber-denies-james-kennedy-abuse-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jim-leyland.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jim-leyland.html>Who is Jim Leyland dating?

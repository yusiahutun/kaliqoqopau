【INDEX】
​​間瀬有里先生：医学博士。東京ミッドタウンクリニック、浜松町ハマサイトクリニックに勤務。日本医科大学医学部医学科卒業。日本産科婦人科学会専門医。日本産科婦人科学会指導医。日本女性医学学会認定女性ヘルスケア専門医。東京ミッドタウンクリニックと同フロアでは、管理栄養士が常駐し、より健康でより美しい生活をサポートするためのヘルスケアショップ TMMC Plus（ティーエムエムシープラス）が展開。 葉酸サプリメントとは？性質やはたらきを解説dragana991//Getty Images
葉酸は、水溶性ビタミンであるビタミンB群に属する栄養素のひとつ。妊娠中の女性に必要なものとして知られているが、実は妊娠に関わらず、男女ともに大切な栄養素だ。
葉酸のはたらき「葉酸は、人の健康に欠かせない栄養素です。それが妊娠初期に特に葉酸が必要だと言われる理由です。また、ビタミンB12とともに健やかな体作りをサポートするとも言われています」（間瀬先生）
妊娠前から葉酸を摂取すべき理由は？厚生労働省が出している「妊娠前からはじめる妊産婦のための食生活指針」によると、「妊娠に気づく前の段階から葉酸を十分に摂取していることが大切です。この時期に葉酸のサプリメントを摂取することにより、胎児の健康リスクが低減することが数多くの研究で明らかになっています」と書かれている。
特に必要なのは受胎後およそ28日とされ、妊娠に気づく前であることが多いため、妊娠前から積極的に葉酸をとることがすすめられている。
「葉酸が多く含まれる食材にはブロッコリーや茹でた枝豆、ほうれん草、海苔などがありますが、葉酸は水溶性ビタミン。水に溶け出すので、水を使わない電子レンジ調理やスープ、味噌汁など調理したものを丸ごと食べられる料理に使うのがおすすめです」（間瀬先生）
1日に摂取したい葉酸の量「厚⽣労働省の『日本人の食事摂取基準（2020版）』では、1日にとりたい葉酸の量は成人の男女ともに240μgとされています。妊娠前や妊娠初期には、さらにサプリメントなどから400μgの葉酸をとることがすすめられており、妊娠中期〜後期にかけて、さらに授乳中にも十分に摂取することが望ましいです」（間瀬先生）
1日に必要な葉酸の量はこちら。
※μg＝マイクログラム（100万分の1グラム）
成人の男女……240μg妊娠前〜妊娠初期……240μg＋サプリメントなどから400μg妊娠中期〜妊娠後期……480μg授乳中……340μg葉酸サプリメントのメリット・デメリット「メリットは、食事でとり切れなかった栄養素をサプリメントで補えることです。基本的に栄養素は食事からとることが望ましいですが、忙しくて難しい日もありますよね。葉酸は、とるタイミングや時間帯をそこまで気にしなくていい成分ですので、思い立ったときに気軽にとっていただけると思います。デメリットは特にありませんが、過剰摂取には気をつけましょう」（間瀬先生）
葉酸サプリメントはいつからいつまで摂取すべき？「成人の男女ともに1日あたり240μgが推奨量ですので、食事やサプリメントで毎日とっておきたい栄養素ではあります。 厚生労働省は、妊娠前から妊娠初期にサプリメントなどからの葉酸摂取を推奨しています。しかし、妊娠前から妊娠・授乳期を通して、十分な摂取を心がける必要があります。そのため、私は授乳中もサプリメントを飲み続けてもいいのではと考えています。授乳によって赤ちゃんに栄養をあげていることと、第1子の授乳中に第2子を妊娠される方もいらっしゃいますので、基本は食事からですが推奨量を満たせるように葉酸サプリメントを活用するのがいいのではないでしょうか」（間瀬先生）
葉酸サプリメントの選び方Yana Tatevosian//Getty Images
たくさんの種類がある葉酸サプリメントから、自分に合うものを選ぶには？間瀬先生に聞いた3つのポイントをレクチャー。
1. 葉酸含有量で選ぶ妊娠の有無、妊娠前、妊娠中、授乳中などの時期によって1日に摂取したい葉酸の量をチェック。普段の食事内容を加味した上で、含有量から選ぶのがおすすめ。
2. その他の配合成分で選ぶ健康には葉酸だけでなく、鉄分やビタミンB12なども必要。また妊娠中はカルシウムの補給も大切。合わせて摂れるタイプを選ぶのもひとつの手。
3. 飲みやすさで選ぶカプセルや粒タイプのものから、グミやキャンディ、チュアブルなどサプリメントのタイプはさまざま。飲みやすく続けやすいものを選んでみて。

<time>27 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>In Shakespeare's timeless tragedy, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth's character serves as a catalyst for the play's central themes of ambition, power, and moral corruption. She is portrayed as a cunning, ambitious woman who manipulates her husband to commit heinous acts to attain power. The complexity of her character raises intriguing questions about the nature of human behavior and the motivations behind it. In this essay, I aim to examine Lady Macbeth's motivations from an evolutionary psychology perspective, exploring why women might have evolutionary incentives to encourage their husbands to take risks to achieve power, even when these actions might diverge from the husbands' own interests.</p><footer><a href=../../why-was-lady-macbeth-evil.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../starbucks-bodhidharma.html></a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

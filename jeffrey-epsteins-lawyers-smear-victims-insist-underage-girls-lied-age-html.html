'federal prosecutors reviewed contradictory sworn statements given by the same witnesses, and obvious inconsistencies between the reports of witness statements taken by the police and their actual sworn statements'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They wrote: 'The sworn statements, taken by police before defense counsel was ever retained, created other issues for the federal prosecutors because the statements indicated that women who were under the age of 18 told police that they misrepresented their age to Mr. Epstein to gain entry into his home'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Epstein's lawyers said that the victims' were trying to 'make a mockery of the judicial system' and were trying to 'manipulate' the legal system for their own financial benefit.</p><p

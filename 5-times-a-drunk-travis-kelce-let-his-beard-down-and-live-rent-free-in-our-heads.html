<time>23 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Travis Kelce may got down in history as one of the most famous tight ends, but the drunk Trav we all know and love should receive a spot as well.</strong></p><p>One thing <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> is good at – besides enjoying himself when he’s a little too drunk – is not caring what other people think. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> fans roasted the athlete <a href=#>over his wardrobe</a> (remember the 1989 fit?), and his relationship has reached the next level when it comes to the strange ways people try to get a photo. In spite of all that, the 34-year-old is enjoying himself. His team, the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a>, just won another <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> and he bought a new mansion last year. It also seems the hottest <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> on the planet are taking time to embrace their time together too. Here’s some of his best moments – never change Travis Kelce.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-times-travis-kelce-got-drunk-and-had-a-good-time>5 times Travis Kelce got drunk and had a good time</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-drunk-singing-at-the-super-bowl-parade>Travis Kelce drunk singing at the Super Bowl parade</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Chiefs celebrated their victory with a rally and a parade in the city after being named Super Bowl champions once again. Before the big game, Travis himself said he wanted to get his ‘own ring’, when quizzed if <a href=#>he’d propose to Taylor Swift</a> if the walked away victorious.</p><p>He got what he wanted.</p><p>But Travis Kelce seemed a little too drunk when he started singing ‘Friends in Low Places’ on stage. He was clearly happy with the team’s performance this year.</p><p>We don’t think Tay-Tay needs to worry about her <a href=#>Grammys</a> at this point.</p><p>Fans loved him letting loose.</p><p>One wrote: “Just when you think Travis can’t get any cringier… he out cringes himself!”</p><p>A second commented: “Love that Mahomes always save the naughtiness of Travis like a protecting brother!”</p><p>While a third hit back at fans claiming he acted like a ‘fool’. They said: “Chill out, he’s had a bit too much to drink. Can’t handle his alcohol lol. He will be feeling it in the morning and I’m sure he isn’t the only one.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-another-super-bowl-victory>Another Super Bowl victory</h2><p>The Chiefs have won four times so there’s likely to be a few clips of Travis Kelce celebrating, whether shouting, a little drunk or singing.</p><p>Last year, he was seen pouring beers at Uncle Woodys bar and drinking out of the jug as he poured himself a beverage. We don’t think this was his first one!</p><p>The 34-year-old had returned to Cincinnati to visit the bar, which is a favorite for students of the college. Although <a href=#>Travis Kelce took a decade to graduate college</a> himself.</p><p>One fan wrote: “Travis is a god of UC. Godbless him and all he’s done for our weird Midwest college.”</p><p>Again, you can’t get positive comments without some people pushing out negativity. Some commentators were claiming he ‘wasn’t welcome back’, without giving enough reasons behind their troll answers.</p><p>A devoted football fan came to the defense of a drunk Travis Kelce: “Everyone’s saying he’s not welcome here because he plays for the chiefs and won the super bowl? I’m so confused lmfao. I’m proud that a Cincy (and Cleveland) boy won the super bowl. 😂 He always shows his love for the city. Y’all are just mad.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-look-what-you-made-him-do>Look what you made him do</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-13-at-11.51.48-628x1024.png><p>In November, Kelce burst into singing a song again – seems to be a staple for a drunk Travis – alongside Taylor Swift.</p><p>The pair were enjoying a karaoke session and belted out Wheatus hit Teenage Dirtbag at his home.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> WSJ Magazine: “There was some wine involved, for sure.”</p><p>One of his friends, they were ‘hitting the right notes’ in terms of their blossoming relationship. Whether Trav did the same for his singing skills, we’re not convinced.</p><p>“[They’re] peas in a pod,” the friend said. “[It was] a sweet, magical moment.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-enjoy-drunk-sing-a-long-to-her-song>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift enjoy drunk sing-a-long to her song</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Then at the Super Bowl After Party this year, Taylor and Travis were celebrating the big win at a club in Las Vegas.</p><p>They shared a <a href=#>kiss while an EDM remix of Love Story</a> pumped through the speakers and fans loved the PDA.</p><p>Later on, they were seen sining across the room at each other to more lyrics during You Belong To Me.</p><p>So cute.</p><p>They were out partying with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes, who called it a night at around 3.30am. But Trav and Taylor, both 35, kept the party going until 5.15am. They apparently ordered chicken fingers and fries too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kept-the-good-times-going>Kept the good times going</h2><p>Back in 2020 when they won the Super Bowl – do you see a pattern here? – a drunk Travis Kelce out in the wild was spotted drinking beer off the Lombardi Super Bowl Cup.</p><p>He wrote: “Growing up playing hockey, I always wanted to chug out of the Stanley Cup after being crowned a Champion…. No cup on the Lombardi, so I decided to take a ride down the Lombardi Luge!”</p><p>One fan declared: “God Damn you are the coolest! Not to mention best TE in football!”</p><p>While others highlighted, as this was just before the coronavirus pandemic he’s likely not going to do it again.</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688.

Trav’s family and friends were watching the Chiefs game in a VIP suite at Highmark Stadium, but Jason had other plans.</p><p>The Philadelphia Eagles center – who retired this week – joked he had about ’40 beers’ before celebrating his younger brother’s touchdown.</p><p>“I got caught up in the energy of Bills Mafia. It is electric,” Jason told Travis later on their shared podcast New Heights.</p><p>“I thought I gotta have my shirt off at some point and i didn’t get to do it beforehand.</p><p>“I didn’t want have my shirt off in the suite so I thought I’m gonna take off my shirt then jump out of the box and then I can be with my Buffalo Bills compadres.</p><p>“This is how my mind works after 40 Miller Lites.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WFcIGMraCmnaNirm6w0a6lpGWkp663tdJmop6kk5p6rbHTZp%2Biq12XsqK%2Bw2abqK%2BeYq6vsIyloK%2BdXaeyr8CMn6menV2eu2671KtkoZ2RmcBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-times-a-drunk-travis-kelce-let-his-beard-down-and-live-rent-free-in-our-heads.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f5-times-a-drunk-travis-kelce-let-his-beard-down-and-live-rent-free-in-our-heads.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f5-times-a-drunk-travis-kelce-let-his-beard-down-and-live-rent-free-in-our-heads.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f5-times-a-drunk-travis-kelce-let-his-beard-down-and-live-rent-free-in-our-heads.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-times-a-drunk-travis-kelce-let-his-beard-down-and-live-rent-free-in-our-heads.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-times-a-drunk-travis-kelce-let-his-beard-down-and-live-rent-free-in-our-heads.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./red-carpet-looks-2023-sag-awards.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./red-carpet-looks-2023-sag-awards.html>Every Red-Carpet Look from the 2023 SAG Awards</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./king-lil-g-designer.html>Who is King Lil G dating?

<time>26 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As her husband Prince Edward continues to take on new responsibilities on behalf of <a href=# id=auto-tag_king-charles data-tag=king-charles>King Charles</a>, royal commentators have their eyes on <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1769971>Duchess Sophie’s title</a> and role in the royal family. Prince Edward’s wife is formally known as Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Edinburgh, but thanks to her growing position in the royal family, some experts are coining their own new term for <a href=# id=auto-tag_duchess-sophie data-tag=duchess-sophie>Duchess Sophie</a> as the “royal family’s secret weapon.”</p><p>According to royal commentator Afua Hagan, Duchess Sophie, 59, has reached this status because of her ability to connect with people during her numerous engagements in recent weeks. She often works behind the scenes, while her husband, Prince Edward, has started stepping into the spotlight in his own way. Hagan told <a rel=nofollow href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Prince Edward, now 60, feels “really privileged” to attend public-facing royal events “on behalf” of King Charles III and Prince William, suggesting that he might also be a “secret weapon” for the royal family.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meghan-markle-king-charles.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/king-charles-cancer-update.jpg><p>Sophie’s new role in the royal family comes in the wake of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1769960>King Charles’ cancer diagnosis</a>, which has resulted in his siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, taking on more public responsibilities as he undergoes treatment and continues his royal duties privately. In particular, Prince Edward and his wife have been dubbed as somewhat of a new “chosen couple” by King Charles, as Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton have also taken a step back from their public duties as Kate undergoes her <a href=#>own cancer treatment</a>.</p><p>As part of her increased duties, Sophie recently stepped in for a royal appearance typically reserved for someone like Princess Kate herself. The duchess was invited to walk across Abbey Road’s iconic crosswalk, famously known from The Beatles’ album cover in 1969, as part of the Orbis Visionaries Reception at Abbey Road Studios on April 25, 2024. Dressed in a vibrant red dress, Sophie recreated the Beatles’ scene for herself, and the moment was also photographed for royal followers to enjoy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/duchess-sophie.jpeg><p>Duchess Sophie attended the Orbis Visionaries Reception as the Global Ambassador for the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. This cause is particularly meaningful to Sophie because her daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, was born with esotropia, a rare eye condition that required corrective surgery. (Fortunately, the surgeries were successful, and Lady Louise is now a student at university.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Sophie’s husband, Prince Edward, recently represented King Charles at a tribute to fallen Australian and New Zealand armed forces members in London on Anzac Day. This was his most significant role yet, given that such ceremonies are typically led by the King and Queen.</p><p>However, despite Duchess Sophie and Prince Edward’s increased responsibilities, there are still some tensions in the royal family. Edward was recently “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1769971>snubbed</a>” by King Charles when he announced new royal appointments on April 23, 2024. Edward’s name was notably missing from the list, while other members like Kate and William received honors.</p><p>According to a recent report by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Us Weekly</a>, Edward had hoped for recognition due to his dedication to the arts and his work in theater. A source told the outlet that it was “disappointing” for Edward to not be recognized by his older brother. But it seems the snub has not deterred Edward’s loyalty, as he and Sophie continue to support one another while fulfilling their duties within the royal family. “Charles has done nothing but sing their praises lately and it’s brought them even closer as brothers,” the insider noted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/king-charles-inherit.webp><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm9wcm9oZLG2r8eeqqxlo6S9qbXEZquirJyafA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fduchess-sophie-title.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fduchess-sophie-title.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fduchess-sophie-title.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fduchess-sophie-title.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fduchess-sophie-title.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fduchess-sophie-title.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dickie-die-ripley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dickie-die-ripley.html>Does Dickie Really Die in Ripley?

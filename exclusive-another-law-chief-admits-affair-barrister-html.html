<time>05 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The Government was hit by a second legal marital scandal last night after it was revealed that Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had an affair with Britain’s leading Asian woman barrister.</p><p>Cabinet Minister Lord Goldsmith, who is in charge of prosecutions and is Tony Blair’s senior legal adviser, confirmed that he had an extra-marital affair with attractive Anglo-Indian lawyer Kim Hollis.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>href="./pages/newsletters/index.html?in_page_id=711">Sign up for the latest news alerts</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>‘My wife knows all about this and has done for a long time,’ the Labour peer said in a statement to The Mail on Sunday. ‘This is a private matter and my wife and I have no further comment.’</p><p>Divorced mother of two Mrs Hollis, who is nearly ten years younger than 57-year-old Lord Goldsmith, was educated at Cheltenham Ladies College. She became Britain’s first Asian QC in 2002 when she was made a ‘silk’ by Lord Goldsmith’s Cabinet colleague and friend, Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer.</p><p>She has worked on high-profile prosecutions including that of a man who stole Victoria Beckham’s luggage including her underwear at Heathrow airport in 2001.</p><p>Last week it was revealed that the Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald was having an affair with blonde barrister Kirsty Brimelow.</p><p>Intense speculation followed in Whitehall that another senior legal figure was embroiled in a similar scandal.</p><p>Lord Goldsmith refused point blank to get involved in claims that Sir Ken was guilty of a conflict of interest, saying it was a ‘private matter’.</p><p>But yesterday, the peer admitted that he too had been having an affair with a barrister who is even more high profile.</p><p>When The Mail on Sunday contacted the Attorney General’s office at 10am yesterday, his spokesman knew nothing about the matter. Later in the day, after contacting the peer, the spokesman confirmed the affair.</p><p>The disclosure that Britain’s two most powerful law officers were having affairs with members of their own profession is bound to lead to serious questions about their judgment.</p><p>It comes at a critical time for the Crown Prosecution Service, which is run by both men. Sir Ken is in charge of its day-to-day running while Lord Goldsmith is in overall command.</p><p>The CPS is shortly to make the most politically sensitive decision in its history when it has to decide whether to prosecute key Downing Street figures over the loans for peerages scandal.</p><p>Lord Goldsmith yesterday interrupted a visit to a legal conference in California to confirm his affair with Mrs Hollis.</p><p>‘It is all in the past and we are both very happy,’ he said, referring to his wife Joy, also 57, who is accompanying him to the conference.</p><p>And he denied any suggestion that he may have used his position to benefit Mrs Hollis’s legal career. ‘Any suggestion of professional advantage being obtained as a result of this is absolute nonsense,’ he insisted.</p><p>Government sources said that the affair ended ‘about two-and-a-half years ago’. Lord Goldsmith’s office declined to say whether it was going on during one of the biggest crises since Tony Blair took office when Lord Goldsmith changed his mind on the legal advice on the Iraq war.</p><p>Having warned that the war could be illegal, he altered his opinion days before the conflict in 2003 under massive pressure from Downing Street.</p><p>If it emerges that the affair was taking place at this time, it could prompt claims that his mind was on other matters or that he was more susceptible to pressure.</p><p>Mrs Hollis was divorced from her husband, businessman Andrew Hollis, in November 2003 after a 16-year marriage. Mr Hollis instituted the divorce proceedings.</p><p>Until three years ago the couple, who have two teenage sons, lived in a multi-million-pound four-bedroomed detached house overlooking Richmond Park in Roehampton, South-West London.</p><p>Mr Hollis, 53, now lives there alone. A month after their divorce, Mrs Hollis bought a £1.5 million home in nearby Fulham. The property is made of two houses knocked into one.</p><p>Asked to comment on his former wife’s affair with Lord Goldsmith, Mr Hollis told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I won’t. I’m not going to say anything because as far as I am concerned whatever happened is all past history.</p><p>‘It would not be right, one way or another, for me to say anything.’</p><p>Mrs Hollis was not at her home in Fulham and could not be contacted last night.</p><p>A Whitehall source said: ‘People started talking after Goldsmith and Mrs Hollis were seen at functions together and then it become known that they were having an affair.’</p><p>One source said that the affair had a ‘predictably devastating effect’ on the Goldsmiths’ marriage.</p><p>Whitehall officials deny that Lord Goldsmith was unable to take key women civil servants on foreign trip because of his wife’s concerns, but insiders say that since the affair Lady Goldsmith has frequently accompanied him on foreign trips such as his current trip to Stanford University at Palo Alto near San Francisco, where he is keynote speaker at a symposium on constitutional law.</p><p>When The Mail on Sunday approached Lord Goldsmith and asked if he had had an affair with Kim Hollis, the peer, who was wearing an untucked blue T-shirt, pulled his wife closely to him and snapped: ‘We are not talking about our private lives. This is not the moment.’</p><p>He ushered away his blonde wife, who was wearing a sundress. The couple had flown to California from the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean, where Lord Goldsmith had chaired a Commonwealth Attorney Generals conference.</p><p>They are staying in a luxurious room at the five-star Stanford Park Hotel in Palo Alto in a suite above the hotel’s courtyard garden which is romantically designed with clipped hedges of fragrant herbs and a central fountain.</p><p>The Goldsmiths became childhood sweethearts after meeting at Mosspits Junior and Infant School in Liverpool.</p><p>They married in 1974 and have four grown-up children, three sons and one daughter.</p><p>They went back to the school together three years ago – around the time that Lord Goldsmith’s affair ended. The couple toured new buildings at the school built under a Private Finance Initiative. Headmistress Barbara Woosey told the Liverpool Echo: ‘Both Lord and Lady Goldsmith were thrilled when they got to the reception class because they remembered the building. It brought back a lot of memories.’</p><p>The school’s other former pupils include MP Edwina Currie, and John Lennon, who went to Mosspits for a short time.</p><p>Joy Goldsmith is the daughter of wealthy property developer Alan Elterman and his wife Margaret.</p><p>She has avoided the limelight but made a rare political intervention in 2005 when she tried to stop the St Stephen’s private club, which is close to their £2.5 million home in Queen Anne’s Gate, a stone’s throw from Parliament, from staying open all night.</p><p>‘It is a quiet street of high quality Grade I listed houses,’ she complained to the local council. ‘To have a late night club would be wholly inappropriate.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKBdIKWcm9ofYh4mZafqI98ZnmepMGpsdFmo5qvXZi1qrHFZpidpZmpwG6txZ%2BYoqpdl66zvsisq56qXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-another-law-chief-admits-affair-barrister-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fexclusive-another-law-chief-admits-affair-barrister-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-another-law-chief-admits-affair-barrister-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fexclusive-another-law-chief-admits-affair-barrister-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-another-law-chief-admits-affair-barrister-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-another-law-chief-admits-affair-barrister-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leilani-malia-mendoza.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leilani-malia-mendoza.html>Leilani Malia Mendoza</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1-on-1-with-kirk-ferentz-longevity-future-and-calling-iowa-city-home.html>1-on-1 with Kirk Ferentz: Longevity, future and calling Iowa City home</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1-on-1-with-kirk-ferentz-longevity-future-and-calling-iowa-city-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

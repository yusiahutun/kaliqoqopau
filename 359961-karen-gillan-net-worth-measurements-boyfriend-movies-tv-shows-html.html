How did this beautiful Scott come to develop an interest in acting and singing? They say an apple does not fall far from the tree. Karen's father, John Raymond Gillan, is a singer and recording artist, and he had a huge influence on his daughter when she was growing up. As a result, she developed a love for acting while still young, went to several youth theatre groups, and was part of various productions at her school.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4a7da52a2db96fe.jpg><p class=align-left>Many of the celebrities who have made it as actors in Hollywood and elsewhere around the world did not just wake up one day and started acting. They spent a lifetime horning and sharpening their skills since childhood so that when the time was ripe, nothing would stand in their way to stardom.</p><p class=align-left>Karen Gillan was barely a teenager when she decided that acting would be her thing, and she sought help from a renowned theatre director Scott Johnston of the Performing Arts Studio Scotland. It took a short while after that before doors started opening for her with roles in movies such as Rebus (2000) and Doctor Who (2005). Today, she is an actress, director, screenwriter, and model.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/98cdd5cfdcf4cbee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie McGrath: height, sexuality, spouse, heterochromia, latest updates</span></p></a><h2>Karen Gillan profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Name:</strong> Karen Sheila Gillan</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> November 28, 1987</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> Inverness, Scotland</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>32 years old</li><li><strong>Birth sign:</strong> Sagittarius</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> 1.78 m (5'10")</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>58 kg</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Actress, director, screenwriter, model</li></ul><h2>Karen Gillan biography</h2><p class=align-left>Karen Sheila Gillan was born on November 28, 1987, in Inverness, Scotland, to Marie Paterson and Raymond Gillan. She decided to become an actress while still young, and when she was 16 years old, she joined Telford College in Edinburg.</p><p class=align-left>After two years, she moved to London where she studied at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. During this time, she was scouted by a modelling agency and began her career as a model, but she was certain that her passion was in acting and not the former. As a model, she premiered at the London Fashion Week in 2007.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffcd96ee5df762a5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brooke Burns net worth, height, children, measurements, husband</span></p></a><h3>Measurements</h3><p class=align-left>The actress has a slim body build and is considerably tall. Karen Gillan's body measurements are 34-26-34 inches. Karen Gillan height is 1.78 meters, which is 5 feet and 10 inches tall (178 cm). When it comes to her weight, she is 58 kilograms (128 lbs). The actress wears a dress size 6 (US) and shoe size 9 (US). Her other body features include brown eyes and red hair colour.</p><h3>Karen Gillan boyfriend</h3><p class=align-left>Who is Karen Millan married to? Karen is not yet married. However, she has had quite some relationships, both low-key and public. The actress was 18 years old when she first fell in love, and she described it as somewhat electrical. At that time, she was forced to choose between her career and her relationship.</p><p class=align-left>This is because her boyfriend was in Scotland while she was in the USA, and the long-distance was not helping their relationship. She dated a photographer named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Patrick Green for six years</a>. She is also rumoured to have been in a relationship with actors such as Andrew Brooke and Matt Smith, who has Karen Gillan partner in Doctor Who. The actress is currently single and not in a rush to be in a relationship, but she has made it clear she would love to have children someday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/792c703be21a0834.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bella Dayne bio: family, net worth, measurements, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>MLB host Lauren Shehadi biography: nationality, dating, salary, net worth</p><h3>Movies</h3><p class=align-left>Since childhood, Karen has always been a horror movie lover.

The Scottish actress Karen Gillan net worth is estimated to be around <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$2 million</a>. It is a considerably high amount and seeing that she is at the peak of her career she will be even richer in the coming years as she features in more and more films. Had she been involved in modelling more, Karen would probably be richer, but she is contented with what she already has.</p><h3>Did Karen Gillan wear a wig in Jumanji?</h3><p class=align-left>The huge success of Jumanji in Box Office brought unprecedented fame to Karen Gillan and her fellow crew members. However, many people were more curious not about the actress but her hair. It was believed that she wore a wig, but it was surprising to learn that the red hair was hers <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">plus a few extensions</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Karen Gillan always had great dreams and expectations as a child, and that is how she ended up being the star she is today. Not even a promising career as a model could distract her from becoming an actress. Many a time, people tend to hold on to the first thing to come their way hence losing grip of the bigger picture. Even though she had her TV debut in 2006, she had to be patient until 2010 when she got her film debut after which roles and roles have come calling. As a fan of horror movies, she has the upper hand when it comes to being featured in such films, and she has suggested that she would love it if her children would follow in her footsteps.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Elizabeth Huberdeau bio kids, career, photos and net worth 2020</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlHJwb2ldoK6zsc1mnqKknJa7brrErWSwp6KptW65xJqqrqqVorKvwNJmmaixlqe2prrDZqSorpmawG7A1WaqoaenqHupwMyl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f359961-karen-gillan-net-worth-measurements-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f359961-karen-gillan-net-worth-measurements-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f359961-karen-gillan-net-worth-measurements-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f359961-karen-gillan-net-worth-measurements-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f359961-karen-gillan-net-worth-measurements-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f359961-karen-gillan-net-worth-measurements-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./young-m-a-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./young-m-a-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship.html>Young M.A Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth &amp;amp; Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./debbie-frank.html>Debbie Frank, Astrologer - HELLO!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./debbie-frank.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Then what does life throw at a person to make lyrical lemonade? You know, lemonade tastes sharp-tongued, but lyrical lemonade has all the nuances of music. Lyrical Lemonade is actually a company that deals exclusively with multimedia, such as creating music videos, exclusive content, live events, and much more. It has so many amazing musicians and music lovers who swear by its creative and innovative approach to music. Whenever someone thinks of Lyrical Lemonades, one person comes to mind, and that person is none other than Cole Bennett.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bio (Age) – Who Is Cole Bennett?</strong></h2><p>Cole Bennett is the founder of the music giant Lyrical Lemonade. He is also a successful creative video director. To really learn more about this savvy business executive, we have to go way back to the beginning.</p><p>It all began on May 14, 1996, in Chicago when a little boy was born. As a grade school student, he bought a CD that sparked his interest in rap. This CD was Get Rich or Die Trying by 50 Cent. Then he discovered coincidence, and this kind of love defined his love closer to Chicago. He started going to all the music shows Chicago had to offer and in high school, he was really addicted to it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cole-Bennett.jpg><p>Lyrical Lemonade began as a blog when Cole was in his senior year. He used it to tell the stories of seemingly small musical numbers in the city of Chicago. He wrote on the blog every day and wrote about five articles a day. After graduating, the guy grew up in Plano Illinois and moved to Chicago for a college education.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Anita Sarkeesian, What Is Her Net Worth, Here’s Everything To Know</a></strong></p><p>He attended DePaul University and focused on digital cinema. This course fell far short of his expectations and was like a barrier to his passion for music. In the middle of his sophomore year, Cole made the big decision to drop out of school and focus entirely on Lyrical Lemonade, a decision he has never regretted to this day. He never stopped making videos for the local artists during his school years, so by the time he dropped out, he already had a place in Chicago’s music scene. Cole was also known for creating a variety of ciphers in which people were basically just connected. It was his way of making sure that everyone was heard.</p><p>Apparently, Cole’s big breakthrough came with the video Workin It by Soulja Boy. He did the animation on the video, and it sold his name. It is said that he learned much of his knowledge from the YouTube tutorials, including his animation skills. Another great success was the connection and collaboration with Dex, the famous rapper. He made about 15 videos and even got 14 million views with Hit Em Wit It. Other musicians he has worked with include Smokepurpp, Lil Pump, Warhol, Wiz Khalifa, Comethazine, and Han Vader.</p><p>Lyrical Lemonade naturally evolved from a simple local blog into a website for small businesses. Elliot Montanez, Cole’s friend, takes care of the day-to-day running of the website. The company also sells merchandising items such as T-shirts, lighters, hoodies, and water bottles.<a href=# rel=noopener> Lyrical Lemonade</a> also has a YouTube channel with over 5.8 million subscribers and 1.7 billion views since joining on March 25, 2013, and has over 250,000 followers on Twitter and 1.1 million on Instagram. Cole Bennett himself is active on social media platforms and has an anticipated huge fan base. He has over 354,000 followers on Twitter and 1.2 million on Instagram.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>His Net Worth</strong></h2><p>According to a recent Forbes list, this young music director is worth about $1.5 million. This is not surprising considering his many creative opportunities in his lyrical lemonade business. Ceteris paribus, this number will increase even further as he continues to shoot interesting videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family and Other Facts</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cole-Bennett-and-Girlfriend-1.jpg><p>For so many years, most of the music videos that Cole shot were shot in his mother’s house. This shows the support he received from her and her contribution that made him the star he is today.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>George Soros Wife (Spouse), Sons, Daughter, Religion, Is He Dead?</a></strong></p><p>In April 2016, his sister presented him with a birthday present that took him further up the career ladder. It was a surprise trip to Coachella that promptly turned Cole into a networking event. He met up with artists like Lil Pump, Stitches, and SmokePurpp and went into business with them and a number of others. That’s definitely what the family is for.</p><p>Cole’s birth sign is Taurus, his love life is a mystery to many, but it is known that he once dated Lana Marie, a photographer. Judging by what he shares on his social media platforms, he is in a relationship with the blonde shown above. He regards her as his “ride or dies”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpufobJursSnpZ6spGK1qr%2BMm6CoZZGcsm66xK1ksKeiqbVussCmoKWxXaTBqbHRZp2am6SofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-cole-bennett-his-bio-age-net-worth-family-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-cole-bennett-his-bio-age-net-worth-family-other-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-cole-bennett-his-bio-age-net-worth-family-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-cole-bennett-his-bio-age-net-worth-family-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-cole-bennett-his-bio-age-net-worth-family-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-cole-bennett-his-bio-age-net-worth-family-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eve-wembanyama-parents-felix-mother-siblings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eve-wembanyama-parents-felix-mother-siblings.html>Eve Wembanyama Parents: Meet Flix Wembanyama Mother And Siblings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./virginia-driver-wants-eat-the-kids-first-html.html>Virginia driver wants to 'EAT THE KIDS FIRST'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./virginia-driver-wants-eat-the-kids-first-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

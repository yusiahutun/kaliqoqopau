No one was sentenced to death in Missouri in 2014 or 2015, Dunham said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'As these executions take place, fewer and fewer people are being sentenced to death, so the death penalty is withering on the other end,' Dunham said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>None of the 25 other men on Missouri's death row face imminent execution.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Sixteen have yet to exhaust court appeals and aren't likely to do so anytime soon. Execution is on hold for nine others. Two were declared mentally unfit for execution. Two were granted stays because of medical conditions that could cause painful deaths during lethal injection.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Two had sentences set aside by the courts due to trial attorney errors. One inmate was granted a stay while his innocence claim is reviewed. One case was sent back to a lower court to consider an appeal.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>And in one unusual case, inmate William Boliek was granted a stay by Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in 1997. The case wasn't resolved before Carnahan died in a 2000 plane crash, and a court determined that only Carnahan could overturn the stay. Nixon's office has said Boliek will not be executed.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Executions nationally are on the decline. In 1999, 98 people were executed. That fell to just 28 in 2015 - a 24-year low - and 13 so far in 2016.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKAdoSTa2hyZ32ewLS71KugZqWRo3q0r8eem66klZl6pbXEZqKipJyeu6h5w56nrqypYn9uu9OhnKurXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmissouri-man-scheduled-die-killing-deputy-2-others-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmissouri-man-scheduled-die-killing-deputy-2-others-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmissouri-man-scheduled-die-killing-deputy-2-others-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmissouri-man-scheduled-die-killing-deputy-2-others-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmissouri-man-scheduled-die-killing-deputy-2-others-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmissouri-man-scheduled-die-killing-deputy-2-others-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./august-alsinas-net-worth-in-the-millions-because-he-can-hit-those-high-notes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./august-alsinas-net-worth-in-the-millions-because-he-can-hit-those-high-notes.html>August Alsinas net worth in the millions because he can hit those high notes Tue 1 November</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lady-gaga-giant-oceanside-greenhouse-unprecedented-look-malibu-house.html>Lady Gaga reveals giant oceanside greenhouse in unprecedented look at $22m house</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lady-gaga-giant-oceanside-greenhouse-unprecedented-look-malibu-house.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

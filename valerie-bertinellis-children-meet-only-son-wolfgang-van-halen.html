<time>01 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Although she is not a mom to many children, Valerie Bertinelli’s son Wolfgang has been making a name for himself in the music scene.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s been over three decades since Valerie Bertinelli’s romance with the famous rockstar Eddie Van Halen made headline news. The superstar couple became household names with romantic escapades during the early 90s. Valerie and Eddie fell in love quickly after they met, and their feelings were so strong that they married after dating for eight months.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/69/0a/c4/690ac41ab7507102e912a87b25dfe275.jpg><p>After the wedding, Valerie addressed most people’s doubts about how quickly the duo moved in their romance. She explained they trust one another and that nothing would destroy their relationship because they are both monogamous. Soon after their marriage, the “One day at a Time” star welcomed their only son, Wolfgang Van Halen, in 1991.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the couple’s marriage started experiencing major cracks due to Eddie’s refusal to rid himself of his drug addiction and endless partying despite being diagnosed with oral cancer in 2000. Just a year afterward, the duo called an end to their decade-long marriage. However, it became official in 2007.</p><p>Although her marriage didn’t go the way she wanted, Valerie still had her son and shifted her focus to raising him. The actress has always maintained a deep devotion to motherhood, and as she <a href=#>said in her book</a> “Losing It,:”</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=3.5><p><strong>“Of all the roles I have taken, none has been more satisfying than motherhood. So I shunned the spotlight in favor of a normal life, driving carpools, volunteering in my son’s classroom [and] making dinner.”</strong></p></figure><p>After her marriage to Eddie failed, Valerie willfully promised to raise her child solely and focus on things that mattered. As promised, Valerie did that and succeeded in raising her son. Below are details about Valerie Bertinelli’s only son, Wolfgang Van Halen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Inside_The_Life_of_Wolfgang_Van_Halen></span><strong>Inside The Life of Wolfgang Van Halen.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, Wolfgang inherited his father’s love for music, and the 30-year-old has progressively made a name for himself. Although he is a rock artist like Eddie, Wolfgang wants people to associate his music with himself and not his father. In 2021, the rock star released his hard rock debut album. Speaking about his music journey, <a href=#>Wolfgang told PEOPLE</a>:</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2><p><strong>“It’s as personal as can be. Songwriting is a therapeutic thing for me, so I was working out a lot of stuff with these songs.”</strong></p></figure><p>Wolfgang explained his music writing process, stating that his lyrics are written at something or someone. The musician noted that he writes in a manner that anyone who’s ever done him wrong or lied to him amalgamates into the one person he writes his lyrics at. Wolfgang also explained he worked on the album for over two years while he cared for his father, Eddie, battling lung cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>Although fans expect Wolfgang to sound and perform exactly like his dad, the young musician has chosen to be himself and is comfortable with his unique music style. Starting as a solo musician, Wolfgang didn’t have it all smooth, but he refused to be discouraged by his circumstances. His band name Mammoth WVH got its inspiration from his dad and uncle’s band, which the singer created while he was young. He <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=3.5><p><strong>“Every time my dad would tell me that story, I always loved the name Mammoth so much that I would tell myself, ‘When I grow up, I’m going to call my own band that.’ And here we are,”</strong></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Engagement_With_his_Girlfriend_And_Grammy_Award_Loss></span><strong>His Engagement With his Girlfriend And Grammy Award Loss</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In July 2022, Wolfgang announced his engagement to his long-term girlfriend, Andraia Allsop, on social media. It was a long dating phase between the musician and girlfriend before their sweet engagement. The pair started dating in 2015 but kept their affairs private until the duo shared a snippet of Wolfgang’s proposal.</p><p>Fans didn’t take forever to gush over the Instagram post, <a href=#>expressing</a> their joy and showing support for the engaged pair. Among the train of well-wishes, Valerie Bertinelli’s comment made the headline. Wolfgang’s mother said how happy she felt for the rockers.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Wolfgang’s engagement came months after the musician’s loss at the Grammy Awards, where his song track “Distance,” was selected for the best rock music at the 2022 Grammy event. As much as the event didn’t yield in his favor, Wolfgang expressed gratitude for being nominated.&nbsp;</p><p>The musician expressed the nomination brought him closer to his late musician father. During the event’s post-interview, he claimed how he has begun following in Eddie Van Halen’s footsteps. In an<a href=#> Instagram post </a>afterwards:</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=4><p><strong>“We came, we saw, but we did NOT conquer- and that’s ok!” he began the post on Instagram alongside a photo with mom, Valerie Bertinelli, and girlfriend Andraia Allsop. “I got to have a wonderful night with the two most important women in my world.”</strong></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Defence_of_Late_Fathers_Reputation_in_a_Documentary></span><strong>Defence of Late Father’s Reputation in a Documentary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>After Eddie Van Halen died in 2020, the TV channel “REELZ” decided to document his journey, exploring his death in their series, “Autopsy.” Meanwhile, Wolfgang and his mother didn’t perceive the idea as welcoming and aired their unpleasant thoughts in some posts.</p><p>Wolfgang, however, tagged the show as Pathetic and heartless. Somewhere in the comment section, <a href=#>Valerie</a> Bertinelli <a href=#>supported</a> her son’s stand, adding how awful the show idea was.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kw6K4xKugnmWSmr%2B1tc2eo6Who2KwqbXLnamepl2isqbAjKilpbFdqLyvedaoo5%2BfkaO0bsLAp2ShmZyau3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvalerie-bertinellis-children-meet-only-son-wolfgang-van-halen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvalerie-bertinellis-children-meet-only-son-wolfgang-van-halen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvalerie-bertinellis-children-meet-only-son-wolfgang-van-halen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvalerie-bertinellis-children-meet-only-son-wolfgang-van-halen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvalerie-bertinellis-children-meet-only-son-wolfgang-van-halen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvalerie-bertinellis-children-meet-only-son-wolfgang-van-halen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-is-this-picture-taken-discover-the-world-with-these-2-addictive-challenging-travel-games.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-is-this-picture-taken-discover-the-world-with-these-2-addictive-challenging-travel-games.html>Where Is This Picture Taken?

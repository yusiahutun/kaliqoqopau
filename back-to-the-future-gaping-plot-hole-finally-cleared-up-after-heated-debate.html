<time>22 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>As much as fans are wishing for Back To The Future 4 to be confirmed, a huge plot hole from the first release is still a hot debate for film buffs – but it’s finally been solved.</strong></p><p>Back to the Future, a film which follows lovable Marty (Michael J Fox) travel back in time with his scientist friend’s time machine to save his parents and his own life, is a cult classic. Made in 1985, it’s still watched and loved across the globe today. However, there is one part of the plot from Back to the Future which still has <a href=#>movie</a> fans scratching their heads 40 years later.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-back-to-the-future-s-major-plot-hole>Back to the Future’s major plot hole</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-607395774-1024x662.jpg><p>The issue at hand from Robert Zemeckis’ film is based around the character Marty and his parents, as well as one cool looking time machine.</p><p>As Marty travels back in time accidentally in the DeLorean to escape terrorists hunting him down after killing his friend Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) for stealing plutonium, he is faced with a predicament. Marty unknowingly sets the time machine off and finds himself stuck in 1955, without present-day Doc or any more plutonium to get him back home to 1985.</p><p>His time-travelling antics has caused a rift in the time-space continuum and because future events have been changed with his arrival, his parents meeting, falling in love and giving birth to Marty is at risk. To save their marriage – and his own existence – he must help the two teenagers.</p><p>Teenager Marty befriends his younger father, George, as well as his mother, Lorraine, who strangely has a crush on her own son (without her knowing who he really is). Luckily, Marty is able to save the day while Doc Brown masters up a plan to get the DeLorean working again, so Marty can travel back to the future.</p><p>However, fans across the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> sphere are discussing the major plot hole that has fans debating four decades later.</p><p>Director James Gunn, who worked on The Guardians of the Galaxy, critiqued the confusion from his ‘favorite’ movie Back to the Future.</p><p>He said: “Back to the Future&nbsp;SEEMINGLY could be imperfect (why don’t Mom and Dad remember Marty?), but I would still argue it’s a perfect film because there are reasons why this could conceivably be the case (time protects itself from unraveling, etc). Or maybe I’m in denial. Who knows.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Screenwriter closes the case</h2><p>In the movie, when Marty returns to the future – after meeting his parents in the past – there are no memories to suggest his parents said he resembled a person they once knew as teens. It appears they don’t remember the Marty that sparked their love blossoming, or explain why they named their child after him either.</p><p>Even Jurassic World actor <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a> chimed in on the discussion.</p><p>He said on the Back to the Future plot hole: “Maybe they do remember him, tho, not as Marty, as Calvin. When Marty returns to present day 1985, it could have been years since his parents would have perhaps originally noted the uncanny resemblance between their son and that kid from high school 20 years previous.”</p><p>Screenwriter Bob Gale cleared up the <a href=# rel=nofollow>confusion</a> to the Hollywood Reporter. It seems Chris Pratt had the right frame of mind.</p><p>He explained: “Bear in mind that George and Lorraine only knew Marty/Calvin for eight days when they were 17, and they did not even see him every one of those eight days.</p><p>“So, many years later, they still might remember that interesting kid who got them together on their first date.”</p><p>Would you remember someone you met for a week, without a photo or another meeting, two decades later?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(by <a href=#>@quip_witted</a>)<br>Back to the Future II (1989)<br>Plot hole</p><p>After returning from the past in BTTF, Marty McFly (Michael Fox) notices many differences from when he left. But he doesn't notice his girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue) is entirely different from the first movie (Claudia Wells). <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s6ZuqKiu7y</a></p>— movie_goofs (@movie_goofs) <a href=#>December 31, 2018</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>However, there is another plot hole, eagle-eyed fans noticed. In Back To the Future II, the actress who played Marty’s girlfriend Jennifer was re-cast. But it seems no one mentions that either.</p><p>Perhaps we’ll find out in another 40 years.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2WEcK7AnKJmrJ9iwamxjJ%2Bsra2imnqorc%2BipaBloKG8tXnHqKOeZZaeu6K4y7JknKSVlr%2BmsIyup2aZlqmys3nHnpitnZRisaauwK2caA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fback-to-the-future-gaping-plot-hole-finally-cleared-up-after-heated-debate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fback-to-the-future-gaping-plot-hole-finally-cleared-up-after-heated-debate.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fback-to-the-future-gaping-plot-hole-finally-cleared-up-after-heated-debate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fback-to-the-future-gaping-plot-hole-finally-cleared-up-after-heated-debate.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fback-to-the-future-gaping-plot-hole-finally-cleared-up-after-heated-debate.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fback-to-the-future-gaping-plot-hole-finally-cleared-up-after-heated-debate.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./strictly-dianne-buswell-racy-photo-joe-sugg.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./strictly-dianne-buswell-racy-photo-joe-sugg.html>Dianne Buswell shares racy photo of boyfriend Joe you won't believe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./reed-paul-jobs-everything-about-steve-jobs-only-son.html>Reed Paul Jobs: Everything About Steve Jobs Only Son</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./reed-paul-jobs-everything-about-steve-jobs-only-son.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

She became a muse to Saavedra: as well as including her in many of his oil paintings, Saavedra also used her likeness to illustrate his poetry and used her topless image for his album, Suenos Liquidos (Liquid Dreams).</span></p><p><span>She returned to Spain, lost contact with Saavedra, and has not spoken to him since.</span><span> Little did Letizia know that their friendship would come back to haunt her.<br></span></p><p><span>Today, she is a very different woman to the young journalist who befriended bohemian musicians and poets in the Mexican town of Guadalajara.

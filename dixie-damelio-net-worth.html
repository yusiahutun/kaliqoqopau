<time>25 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>With over 55 million followers, it’s easy to see why <a href=#>Dixie D’Amelio’s net worth</a> makes her one of the richest creators on TikTok. But how much does Dixie make from TikTok, exactly?</p><p>Well, in order to understand how <a href=#>Dixie</a> became one of the social media platform’s top earners, we have to take a look back on how she got to where she is today in the first place. Even before she became TikTok royalty, Dixie came from a place of influence. The TikTok creator, who was born in Norwalk, Connecticut on August 12, 2001, is the eldest daughter of &nbsp;Marc D’Amelio, a former Republican Connecticut senate candidate, and Heidi D’Amelio, a former model and photographer. Dixie also has a younger sister, <a href=#>Charli D’Amelio</a>, who has a whopping 147-plus million TikTok followers and counting.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Noah-Beck-Dixie-Damelio-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/dixiedameliointerview.png><p>In September 2021, Hulu released a docuseries about Dixie and her family titled <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The D’Amelio Show</a>, which chronicles the family’s lives and careers in Los Angeles. In the premiere episode of the Hulu reality series, Dixie opened up about the pressures she’s faced since entering the social media spotlight.</p><p>“Tea-pages and negative comments and checking who is talking about me every day is a big part of my anxiety,” she explained. “I do try to hide those feelings by putting out a strong face but I do get very upset.” Dixie went on to add, “Everyone just picks apart every single thing I do and the way I look,” she said. “It hurts so much. Everyone else can show emotions or talk about things and everyone supports them but anytime I talk about literal shit I’ve been through, it doesn’t matter and it just turns into a joke.”</p><p>The TikTok star’s comments prove that there is always a cost to viral fame. But how much is enough to make it all worthwhile? Read on to learn how much is Dixie D’Amelio’s net worth—including how much she makes on TikTok, Instagram and more.</p><h2>How much does Dixie D’Amelio make from TikTok?</h2><p>Dixie first began posting on TikTok in 2019 alongside her sister, Charli. Together, the pair shared lip-syncing and comedy skits, which quickly grew viral in popularity. “I just try to show my personality, because I’m not a dancer, and a big portion of [TikTok] is dancing. And also, Charli and I are two different people, and we’ve always tried to never be in competition,” D’Amelio told Insider in 2020. “I don’t want to do what she’s doing. I don’t want to be a dancer, because that’s her thing and I have my thing.”</p><p>So, we know Dixie has a different strategy than her sister, Charli—but how does this configure into her net worth? Though she has fewer followers, Dixie remains one of the highest-paid creators on TikTok. According to a 2020 report <a href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes</a>,&nbsp;Dixie earned a whopping $2.9 million from partnership deals with brands like Hollister and Morphe in 2020. This put her right behind her younger sister Charli, who made $4 million in her first year on TikTok from sponsorship deals with brands like EOS Cosmetics, Dunkin’ and Sabra Hummus. At the time, Dixie ranked in third place among TikTok’s highest earners. (The record for highest-paid TikTok creator in 2020 was held by <a href=# rel=noopener>Addison Rae</a>, per Forbes.) By 2022, however, both Charli and Dixie had surpassed Addison to become the number-one and number-two top-earning TikTok creators, respectively, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>.</p><p>The magazine reported in 2022 that Dixie earned $10 million in 2021, with a majority of the money coming from Charli and Dixie’s Hollister collaboration, Social Tourist, their Hulu show with their family, The D’Amelio show, and their 10-episode series on Snap. Dixie’s earnings also came from her music career. In 2021, she released two songs, “Psycho,” which featured rapper Rubi Rose and peaked at number 25 on Billboard’s Pop Chart, and “FuckBoy,” which went viral on Dixie’s home platform of TikTok. Dixie also performed as part of the Jingle Ball concert series in 2021, performing in Dallas, Boston and Chicago. She also went on tour with the band Big Time Rush in 2022.</p><h2>What is Dixie D’Amelio’s net worth in 2022?</h2><p>So how much is Dixie D’Amelio’s net worth? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth,</a> Dixie is worth $10 million, which includes the money she makes from TikTok, her sponsorship deals and music career. Dixie released her first single, “Be Happy,” in June 2020. The track, which accumulated over 86 million streams, became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube upon its release. Dixie also makes money from her reality TV show with her family, The D’Amelio Show, which premiered in September 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> in 2022, Dixie explained that her family’s success also came with a negative side. “I get phone calls every day from random people. I answer and just listen. They’re like, “Answer me? Why aren’t you talking?” And then they cuss me out,” Dixie she said. “My house in Connecticut, during the beginning of Covid, people would show up every day and knock on my door.”</p><p>Dixie also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> in 2021 about how she and Charli are still surprised by their life now.&nbsp;“We’re still both kind of shocked when we sit back,” she said. “It’s like, why? What’s going on?” She also explained why she and her family gravitated toward TikTok in the first place. “I feel like TikTok was the first app to show a natural side. Instagram was very perfect and on Twitter you don’t really show your face and it’s just a bit of comedy here and there. But with TikTok you could post in a messy room and show a naturalness and, like, mistakes,” she said. “I think people really liked that, especially when we were all home last year with the pandemic and just doing the same thing. It was nice to see, like, something you could relate to.”</p><p>She continued, “I also think it was a lot about perfect timing. The app was blowing up the same time we got on and we kind of just went up together. We just have to look at it all as a positive thing and at how we can take this and make something amazing out of it.”</p><p>Dixie also told the newspaper about why she wanted to pursue a career in music after her social media success. “I feel like I’m going to be managing that for a long time. But at the end of the day, I’ve always done music, I’ve always loved music, I just didn’t show it online,” she said. “Music’s always been a part of my life and I enjoy it and I love sharing creativity with people so, like, I don’t really care, to be honest. I just want to do what I love and share it with the people who love me.” Though she also talked about the pressure to start her career with a built-in following. “That’s been the scary part, that most people don’t usually have an audience when they start music watching their journey of self-discovery,” she said. “I feel like what I’ve been trying to do is, I don’t wanna force it on anyone. I probably have a new audience who hates my [TikTok] videos but likes my music, so it’s all different. And by now I’m pretty much used to the comments, so it doesn’t really bother me.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The D’Amelio Show</a> is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu.</a></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

LaRosa was one of the ten crewmembers assigned by the TWC to cover the disaster of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 when she was stationed in San Antonio.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson Bio, Husband, Weight Loss, Net Worth, Age, Height and Family</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Maria LaRosa Bio</strong></h2><p>Maria LaRosa was born on 7 November 1976 in Mahopac, New York. However, she grew up in Ramsey, New Jersey. She describes herself as a girl from New Jersey, although she was not born in Jersey.</p><p>As an adolescent, LaRosa was a reserved science freak who preferred to bury herself in her science and math books rather than talk to friends. Young LaRosa was probably too absorbed in her books to even notice the weather and to talk less about it, to discuss it with other people.</p><p>She attended Pennsylvania State University. When she enrolled, she had no idea what career path she would pursue, but a single visit to the university’s meteorology department was enough to convince her. Subsequently, LaRosa graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Meteorology in 1998. Before graduating, she worked as a teaching assistant for the introductory course in meteorology at the university.</p><p>After graduation, LaRosa began her television career as a meteorologist and presenter for WTVM-TV, the ABC station in Columbus, Georgia, from 1998 to 2000. According to the New Jersey weather woman, the news director of WTVM-ABC took a risk with her and gave her a weekend commercial. She was also a news reporter on the same channel.</p><p>After about a year and a half, LaRosa got a spot on the morning show, first as a news anchor and later as a weather presenter. In late 2000, she joined WXIX-TV, a Fox member company in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she worked as a weekend weather presenter for four years. In 2004, LaRosa moved to KYW-TV, a CBS channel in Philadelphia, where she worked as a meteorologist on weekday mornings and lunches.</p><p>In 2010, she moved to The Weather Channel, where she began working as a co-host with Todd Santos on the weather program Weekend Now and PM Edition. Between 2012 and 2014 she hosted Morning Rush and Wake Up With Al.</p><p>She also co-hosted America’s Morning Headquarters’ flagship morning show with Sam Champion and Mike Bettes in 2015. She is currently co-hosting another weekend show Weekend Recharge with Paul Goodloe.</p><p>LaRosa is a member of the National Weather Association and has received the Association’s seal of approval for broadcasting, which is the new CBM (Certified Broadcast Meteorologist).</p><p>This weather woman, like all of us, also has her favorite season. According to her, she enjoys everything that autumn brings, the weather (predictable), food, and holidays. She seems to be an indoor person as she likes to spend time with her family, cooking, and watching movies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Maria LaRosa&nbsp;</strong><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The weather girl from New Jersey is currently estimated at $800,000. Her current salary is about $150,000 a year. Her net worth is expected to increase as she reaches the higher ranks of her career.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Alison Brie’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband and Family</strong></h2><p>Even though LaRosa is almost always on television, very little of her private life can be seen in the media. However, we know that she is married to Mariusz Kolakowski. Kolakowski comes from a very wealthy family and is the only child of his family. He also holds a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University. He currently runs a business near their home in Atlanta.</p><p>The couple has three sons. They welcomed their first son Michael in 2005 and the second, Justin, was born in 2008. They welcomed the youngest Tyler on May 3, 2010. The couple currently resides in Atlanta with their children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Body Measurements</strong></h2><p><strong>Height</strong>: 6ft 2 inches</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 128 lbs</p><p><strong>Bust size</strong>: 36 inches</p><p><strong>Waist Size</strong>: 26 inches</p><p><strong>Hip size</strong>: 36 inches</p><p><strong>Dress Size</strong>: 6 (US)</p><p>She has brown hair and hazel-colored eyes.</p><p>For a mother of three, Maria LaRosa has quite an amazing physique. Therefore, a lot of people have more than one reason to tune in to the weather channel; if not to catch the weather forecast, then to catch a glimpse of the lovely weather girl from New Jersey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqK%2ByJpkpZmipMCiecGipmaglZ60qcCMp5ytZaekv7W0jJumnbFdorKiv9SrnKadnqnAbrTUrJmappRis6K5yKWwaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaria-larosa-bio-height-net-worth-body-measurements-husband-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmaria-larosa-bio-height-net-worth-body-measurements-husband-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmaria-larosa-bio-height-net-worth-body-measurements-husband-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmaria-larosa-bio-height-net-worth-body-measurements-husband-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaria-larosa-bio-height-net-worth-body-measurements-husband-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaria-larosa-bio-height-net-worth-body-measurements-husband-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meaning-of-in-the-night-by-the-weeknd-3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meaning-of-in-the-night-by-the-weeknd-3.html>Meaning of In The Night by The Weeknd</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./elche-cf-21-football-club-facts.html>Elche Cf: 21 Football Club Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./elche-cf-21-football-club-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

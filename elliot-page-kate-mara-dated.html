According to the actor, the two dated while he was filming "X-Men: Days of Future Past" in 2014, shortly after Page came out as gay. In 2020, he then came out as trans.</p><p>"The first person I fell for after my heart was broken was Kate Mara," said Page, who noted Mara "had a boyfriend at the time, the lovely and talented Max Minghella." According to Page, Max was supportive of his then-girlfriend exploring her feelings with Elliot, with Mara allegedly telling Page, "I never thought I could be in love with two people and now I know I can."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:665045dc-2cdf-4f83-a98d-61361af952ce data-container-ref=toofab:article:a11ce9de-87d5-47ee-9ae4-5700a8f9dd07 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8f/5by4/2021/07/01/8f1ceddaabdc439991af77aeeb895f39_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">LGBTQ+ Celebrities Who Were Told To Stay In The Closet</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Though Mara wasn't quoted by the publication, they noted that Page said the actress has read the book and will be supporting Elliot at an event for its release this month. Elliot also said the two -- who also played lovers in the 2017 movie "My Days of Mercy" -- are still close and the "love and care that we have for each other is it's own special thing ... separate from the intimacy that I write about."</p><p>"This was right after I'd come out as gay and it was a time of exploration and also heartbreak. I think my relationship, or whatever you want to call it with Kate, very much encapsulates a certain dynamic that I consistently found myself in, which was falling for people that — I think a lot of us do this — who aren't fully available," said Page. "And the sort of safety in that and the highs and the lows and the serotonin bump, and then it goes away."</p><p>Along that same thread, Page also opened up in the book about dating a closeted female costar whose name he didn't reveal for two years.</p><p>"Some of my friends didn't even know I was in a relationship," said Page, who added that the pair simply pretended to be friends whenever they were in public together.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fb229334-48bb-4df6-80c3-0b6cff31d622 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a11ce9de-87d5-47ee-9ae4-5700a8f9dd07 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c3/5by4/2022/06/01/c3f9c9b7d4c94e2da1138355b776ded8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Elliot Page Says Comedians Targeting Trans Community 'Really Breaks My Heart'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Ultimately, I do think she loved me. We loved each other and that was very real in our bubble. It was fantastic. You know, it was really beautiful. I admired about her and how she inspired me in many ways," wrote Page. "But feeling hidden was far too painful. That was impossible and not a sustainable relationship at all. And it taught me that I was not gonna do that again."</p><p>Page revealed in 2018 that he married Emma Portner, though the two divorced in 2021. Though the two split following Page's transition, Portner was very supportive when Elliot came out as transgender.</p><p>"I also ask for patience and privacy but that you join me in the fervent support of trans life every single day," she said at the time. "Elliot's existence is a gift in and of itself. Shine on sweet E. Love you so much."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:68ff70bc-f4b1-4515-ac3a-e31454696ef4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a11ce9de-87d5-47ee-9ae4-5700a8f9dd07 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/5by4/2022/03/29/77103ce68edf4cf385f510d2ced2a084_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Elliot Page Says He Experienced 'Trans Joy' Wearing a Suit to the Oscars</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maWpfmrmttc6tZKmZl5p6rK3TnmSmmaKWeqWt056baA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felliot-page-kate-mara-dated.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2felliot-page-kate-mara-dated.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2felliot-page-kate-mara-dated.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2felliot-page-kate-mara-dated.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felliot-page-kate-mara-dated.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2felliot-page-kate-mara-dated.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./father-bullied-schoolgirl-adriana-kuch-killed-threatening-sue-school-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./father-bullied-schoolgirl-adriana-kuch-killed-threatening-sue-school-html.html>Father of bullied schoolgirl Adriana Kuch who killed herself is threatening to sue the school</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cary-grant-hid-childhood-trauma-behind-a-different-persona.html></a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cary-grant-hid-childhood-trauma-behind-a-different-persona.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

For the next three years, <a href=#>this stoic and distant planet</a> will bring our awareness to the ways we’ve allowed our imaginations and our emotions to fool us. If you’ve ever found yourself wishing you could return to a simpler time, back to the way things were, this transit will remind you that viewing an imperfect past with rose-colored glasses will only obscure and muddy your vision of the future. Pisces is all about endings, forgiveness and moving on, as this is the <a href=#>last sign in the zodiac wheel</a> and symbolic of a chapter reaching completion. When Saturn moves through this dreamy and transcendent zodiac sign, it calls on you to create a healthy distance from the past as you begin to embrace what the future holds.</p><p>If your <a href=#>sun sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> happens to fall under any of the <a href=# id=auto-tag_mutable data-tag=mutable>mutable</a> signs, here’s why you’ll feel the effects of <a href=# id=auto-tag_saturn-in-pisces data-tag=saturn-in-pisces>Saturn in Pisces</a> <a href=#>even more intensely</a>:</p><h2>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel Saturn in Pisces the Most</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>Are you ready to take your career more seriously than ever? When Saturn enters Pisces, it will place pressure on your 10th house of career, acting as a mentor who uses tough love and discipline in order to encourage your excellence. If you’re not embarking down a career path that means something to you, Saturn will force you to start taking your goals more seriously and to let go of pipe dreams. If you haven’t been bringing your A-game and your efforts have begun to slip, Saturn will bring your attention to where and how you’ve been making mistakes. Although you may find your career—as well as your reputation—going through many ups and downs during this time, this transit will ultimately strengthen your career standing like never before. When your career knocks you down, get back up and refuse to accept defeat. Saturn will reward you for it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>For the next three years, Saturn will erect boundaries and demand seriousness from your relationships. Pisces is your seventh house of partnerships, allies, enemies and spouses, which means harsh and challenging Saturn will reveal any weak links in your unions with the people in your life. Saturn is a planet that rewards longevity and commitment, which could mean you’re ready to get married or take the next step in your relationship with friend or lover. However, because Saturn is a planet that does not tolerate immaturity and bad behavior, this planet will show you the ways in which your relationship dynamics may or may not be healthy. It could also make it harder to date, because Saturn will purposefully prevent you from wasting your time on meaningless flings and situationships. Luckily, by the time it’s over, you’ll understand exactly what you need from a relationship and how to make yours even stronger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>When Saturn enters Pisces, it will hasten the process of karma and the process may feel confronting. For the next three years, Saturn will sift through the skeletons in your closet as it moves through your fourth house of home, family, roots and relatives. Deep and intense truths related to your family and home dynamic may arise, forcing you to heal these rifts and set boundaries that allow you to have a healthier relationship with your blood family and/or your chosen family. If you’ve been uncomfortable in your home environment, this transit will also encourage you to leave your substandard living situation and work on forging something even stronger. Even if you don’t feel like your home is where you want it to be, Saturn will remind you that building a home takes time. And if your home and family are already in pretty decent shape, this transit will remind you to commit to your personal life even more deeply. Although money and career success are important, none of it matters without home, family and of course, honor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pisces.png><p>No one will feel the effects of Saturn in Pisces as intensely as you. As Saturn spends the next three years laying down the hammer in your first house of identity and the “self,” you may feel as though a lot of pressure is being placed on your shoulders. In fact, this could even feel like <a href=#>a mini Saturn return</a> in and of itself! Although many things in your life may be ending, even better things are on the verge of beginning. When Saturn crosses your ascendant, it can make you feel hard on yourself and extra critical of yourself, but that’s only because you’re suddenly beginning to expect so much more from yourself. You’re no longer making excuses and lowering your standards, because Saturn is forcing you to see all that you’re capable of. And unless you start taking things a bit more seriously, you may be settling for less than you deserve. Double up on the self-love and be kind to yourself, because Saturn’s energy might not be easy, but the reward Saturn brings you is a much deeper form of confidence and self-acceptance. I’m so excited for you, Pisces. ♡</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MANIFEST-ISSUE-email-sig.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdIGYbGtyZ6qksaqtwmaqop%2BeqHquu9KtZJqelpqwtbHDZqqarKWnu261zWanoquTmsBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-saturn-in-pisces.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-saturn-in-pisces.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-saturn-in-pisces.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-saturn-in-pisces.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-saturn-in-pisces.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-saturn-in-pisces.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./award-winning-cheese-politics-hit-22514344.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./award-winning-cheese-politics-hit-22514344.html>Award-winning cheese, politics and hit Netflix shows - where are Blur members now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tom-sizemore-saving-private-ryan-actor-dead-at-61-html.html>Tom Sizemore, Saving Private Ryan Actor, Dead at 61</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tom-sizemore-saving-private-ryan-actor-dead-at-61-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

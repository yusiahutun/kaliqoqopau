They divorced in 2014, and she married artist <strong>Keith Tyson</strong> in 2017. Once favored to take over her father’s empire, Elisabeth founded production company Shine Group in 2001. She then made herself rich by selling it back to Rupert’s News Corp in 2011.</p><h2>Lachlan Murdoch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/james-murdoch-shutterstock-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Born on September 8, 1971 in London, England, <strong>Lachlan Keith Murdoch</strong> is Rupert’s first son with Anna and the younger brother of Elisabeth.

The youngest child of Rupert and Anna dropped out of Harvard after studying film and history, started a record label called Rawkus Records, and was ultimately CEO of 20th Century Fox from 2015-2019. He holds dual citizenship in the UK and US. He also had dealings with News Corp as a CEO for Europe and Asia, and later as a member of the board of directors, which he stepped down from in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>James married <strong>Kathryn Hufschmid</strong> back in 2000, and the couple welcomed three children together. <strong>Anneka</strong>, born in 2003, <strong>Walter</strong>, born in 2004, and <strong>Emerson</strong>, born in 2008.

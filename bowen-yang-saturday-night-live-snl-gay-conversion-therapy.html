It's certainly not the kind of conversation anyone would want their parents to see at 17 years old, and it's even worse that he was outed this way.</p><p>To say it came as a culture shock to his Chinese parents is a huge understatement. "They just sat me down and yelled at me and said, 'We don't understand this. Where we come from, this doesn't happen,'" Yang said.</p><p>He also said that he'd only ever seen his father cry at his grandfather's funeral, "and now he's sobbing in front of me every day at dinner."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5a577137-6c12-5716-b11d-21d04f7c96c1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:20ae2eb0-0bee-5f74-9e52-a5afb4802b9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a4/5by4/2020/01/06/a415e05e24ca5fb08cae721ce293ce70_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kate McKinnon Presents Ellen With Carol Burnett Award</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Yang said he was devastated to have thrown his parents into such turmoil and so desperate to do whatever he could to make it right that he even went along with it willingly and determinedly when his dad surprised him with gay conversion therapy sessions.</p><p>"I allowed myself the thought experiment of: 'What if this could work?'," he said. "Even though as I read up on it, I was just like, 'Oh, wait, this is all completely crackers.'"</p><p>Unfortunately, as Yang explained the process by which the therapist tried to work him through and away from his homosexuality, it was clear that he was much smarter than whatever this technique was, seeing through its circular logic and disjointed data.</p><p>"The counselor would go through the circular reasoning thing of, 'Well, weren't you feeling uncomfortable a little bit when saw that boy you liked?' And I was like, 'Not really,'" Yang recalled. "He goes, 'How did your chest feel?' And I was like, 'Maybe I was slouching a little bit.' And he goes, 'See? That all stems from shame.' It was just crazy. Explain the gay away with pseudoscience."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d82bd77a-d453-54b3-9c67-0c239cccaa66 data-container-ref=toofab:article:20ae2eb0-0bee-5f74-9e52-a5afb4802b9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6a/5by4/2020/01/14/6a9ebe2b0e8e582988851f85a60f6669_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Eddie Murphy Took a Break from Hollywood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He said he even tried his best to be straight when he first went away to college, even going so far as to almost convince himself he'd developed a crush on a female student. But it didn't last, obviously, and so he found himself having to have a second "coming out" with his parents.</p><p>This one, at least, was on his own terms. And as he was older, and had certainly been through some experiences by this point, he was able to deal with their lack of acceptance from a healthier and more self-aware place.</p><p>"Eventually, I just got to this place of standing firm and being like, 'This is sort of a fixed point, you guys. I can't really do anything about this. So either you meet me here or you don't meet me.'"</p><p>Through it all, Yang continued to love his parents unconditionally and he was able to accept that this wasn't malicious on their part; it was just something they weren't able to deal with yet. And he says they're still working on it. "I can't rush them," he said.</p><p>Nevertheless, they were both there when Yang made his debut appearance on "Saturday Night Live," showing their support and love as he realized a dream.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?

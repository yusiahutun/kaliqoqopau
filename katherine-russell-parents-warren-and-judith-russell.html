Are they still together?</p><p>We have done some digging up for you so you can learn about them in this article.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Katherine Russell Parents?</strong></h3><p>Katherine Russell was born in Texas on February 6, 1989, to Warren Russell and Judith Russell. She spent the majority of her childhood in suburban Rhode Island, New England. It should therefore come as no surprise that their supposedly Christian home was always very cozy, allowing her to pursue her talents for music and visual art without having to worry too much.</p><p>She did, however, get into problems shortly after earning her diploma from North Kingstown High School in 2007 when she shoplifted five items totaling $67 from an Old Navy store at the neighborhood Warwick Mall.</p><p>As a result of the minor nature of the conduct, Katherine’s charges were actually permanently dropped when she completed community service and made restitution for serious crime victims. She later moved to Boston and enrolled at Suffolk University as a communications major, where she quickly met Chechen-Avar immigrant Tamerlan A. Tsarnaev through mutual friends at a nightclub. They then started dating intermittently, and on June 21, 2010, they got married in an unconventional 15-minute ceremony held in the Masjid office with only two witnesses present.</p><p>The couple then moved into his family’s run-down apartment in Cambridge with his mother and brother, and in late 2010 they even gave birth to their daughter Zahara there. Katherine had to leave college in her junior year to concentrate on her family; in 2008, she apparently willingly took the name Karima after converting to Islam for her partner. It’s important to remember that her parents, particularly her mother, were never supportive of her relationship with Tamerlan because he was supposedly abusive; this had nothing to do with their shared religious beliefs.</p><p>When information about her husband’s involvement in the triple murder and bombings in 2013 became public, Katherine was severely questioned because she had adjusted to her new life as best she could. Web searches for “rewards for the wife of mujahedeen” (Arabic for “holy warrior”) and “If your husband becomes a shahid, what are the rewards for you?” however, did not clearly link the at-the-time part-time home health aide to the crimes.</p><p>Even her DNA and fingerprints were not found on the bombs, and a computer search on hers for the 2011 Waltham case combined with her husband’s name produced no results.</p><p>“[O]ur daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child,” Judith and Warren Russell said in a public statement back then. “We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. In the aftermath of the Patriots’ Day horror, we know that we never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted.”</p><p>In 2013, Warren and Judith made headlines after putting their large detached family home in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, up for sale for $467,000. They have lived there for 14 years but the pain of recent events appears to have forced them to move to make a clean break from the past.</p><p>Public records showed that Warren bought the Colonial-style property on a tree-lined street in a quiet middle-class suburb in 1999.</p><h3><strong>Meet Warren Russell, Katherine Russell Father</strong></h3><p>Warren Russell is the father of Katherine Russell.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Warren Russell Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>He was born in November 1957.

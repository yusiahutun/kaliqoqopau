Nearly everyone will at some time in their lives encounter a temporary or permanent impairment. Approximately 16% of the world’s population, or 1.3 billion individuals, are thought to be significantly disabled at this time. The aging of the population and the rise in the incidence of noncommunicable illnesses are two factors contributing to this statistic. Interactions between people who have a health condition, such as cerebral palsy, can lead to disability. Negative attitudes, inaccessible public transit and structures, and a lack of social support are some of the environmental and human variables that contribute to depression and Down syndrome. The kind and degree of a person’s disabilities are greatly influenced by their surroundings.</p><p>Situations that are not accessible to people with disabilities put up obstacles that frequently prevent them from fully and equally participating in society. Removing these obstacles and helping people with impairments live more easily in daily life can help improve social engagement.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Beyond Limitations: Valuable Insights From Learning Disabilities</a></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What is disability?</h4><p>Any physical or mental ailment (impairment) that makes it harder for the affected individual to engage in particular activities (activity limitation) or engage with their environment (participation limits) is considered a disability.</p><p>There are many different kinds of impairments, including ones that impact an individual’s:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Movement</li><li>Thinking</li><li>Remembering</li><li>Learning</li><li>Communicating</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Mental health</li><li>Social relationships</li></ul><p>Even while the term “people with disabilities” is occasionally used to describe a specific demographic, it refers to a broad category of individuals with a variety of requirements.

Examples of these include the complete loss of a body part, as occurs following amputation of a limb, or a type of nerve damage that may result in multiple sclerosis.</li><li>Functional impairments involving the whole or partial loss of a physical component’s functionality. Stiff joints and loose joints are persistent symptoms.</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What distinguishes participation restriction from activity limitation?</h5><p>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) was released in 2001 by the World Health Organization (WHO).<br>The ICF provides a consistent language for classifying environmental elements that impact health, such as physical function and structure, exercise, and engagement levels. This description helps assess how people’s functioning, activities, and surroundings either support or interfere with their capacity to participate fully in society.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>According to the ICF:</h6><ul><li>• Activity is the carrying out of a duty or activity by a single person.</li><li>• Participation is a person’s participation in a circumstance in life.</li></ul><p>While activities primarily occur at the individual level and participation requires taking part in responsibilities in life, such as work, school, or relationships, the ICF admits that the line between these two categories is not entirely obvious and blends them. The challenges an individual faces in carrying out activities and interacting with others are the basis for activity constraints and participation restrictions. Environmental variables including technology, connections and support, services, rules, and other people’s attitudes can make things easier or harder for people to participate in activities.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>The Old Generation and Use of Technology</a></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>The ICF includes the following in the categories of participation and activity</h5><ul><li>Acquiring and using knowledge</li><li>Handling obligations and duties</li><li><strong>Mobility:</strong> (changing and sustaining bodily postures, manipulating and transporting items, exploring the surroundings, and traveling via transit)</li><li>Organizing self-care activities</li><li>Handling the household duties</li><li>Building and overseeing connections and exchanges with others</li><li>Participating in significant life domains such as school, work, money management, or financing</li><li>Taking part in social, civic, and communal life</li></ul><p>It is critical to enhance the quality of life in communities by offering accommodations that reduce or remove participation barriers and activity limits for individuals with disabilities, enabling them to engage in daily responsibilities and activities.</p><p>Various State Governments have also adopted different sets of definitions for example, the Government of Tamil Nadu declared one – eyed persons in the same category as blind persons and have extended various concessions</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4

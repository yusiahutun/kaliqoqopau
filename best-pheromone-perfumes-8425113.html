You listen to some jams that get you pumped up, put on your hottest outfit, and, before you leave, spritz on some pheromone perfume. Once you get to your destination, just a mere whiff and a glance cause men and women to fall at your feet.

Hard to say. These perfumes designed to attract others can contain synthetic pheromones, versions of substances naturally produced by our bodies that can communicate with and entice others. Some iterations of fragrances within this category won’t contain pheromones, but rather scents that evoke the scent of skin. And there are others that just contain fragrance notes that translate into a bottle of sex appeal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While scent is highly subjective, we decided to put pheromone perfumes to the test. To determine if these scents can really lure secret admirers out of the woodwork, we narrowed down all the best pheromone perfumes on the market to 17, and since this fragrance category is wholly dependent on individual body chemistry, we recruited other InStyle editors so we could experiment each scent on three different editors' skin and hair, as well as fabric to give them a fair shake. We judged the fragrances based on a set of criteria, including wearability (could we only wear it at night?), longevity (if it didn't last, what's the point?), strength (will people smell us coming before they see us?), scent (do we even like it?), and of course, the bottle (we love beautiful things).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-frdric-malle-carnal-flower-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frédéric Malle Carnal Flower</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Malle Carnal Flower Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aF3hZHS2DBcCRllm-Ko9M0SMwsg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nordstrom-frederic-malle-carnal-flower-parfum-spray-e3f583e01d6a40d589e43ec68740838b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This perfume makes you feel sexy, confident, and sophisticated from the moment you put it on.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Because this is a heady, potent fragrance, it’s best reserved for evening wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This fragrance is known to be one of the sultriest scents on the market, making it a must-try when you’re in a magnetic mood. Upon application, we noticed that we instantly felt mysterious and powerful. Carnal Flower has a bold sillage, meaning you can smell its lusty notes of tuberose, jasmine, and musk from a distance as well as leave a trail of scent wherever you go. This makes for a fabulous fragrance to wear when you want to stand out at a crowded party or on an intimate date. A little goes a long way and lasts for hours — we found the scent stayed strong on our skin, even with just one spritz.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re reiterating that this is a potent perfume because it may not be for everyone, especially those who are prone to headaches caused by strong fragrance; we found this to be the case when we tested it on hair as it held the scent a bit too well! Similarly, you may also want to avoid wearing this one during the day so as not to affect the noses of coworkers. (That said, a friend of ours tried it and found that it wore down to a more mellow, flirty scent on her skin, which just goes to show how big of a role body chemistry plays when wearing perfume.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a showstopper of a fragrance you can wear on big nights out, definitely grab yourself a bottle of this one — the sleek packaging will also add a touch of quiet luxury to your vanity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Tuberose, jasmine, bergamot, musk｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> White floral｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-women-byredo-blanche></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Women</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Byredo Blanche</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Byredo Blanche" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J94D6x3-Q5jZzOCM4nwwH2_y02U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byredo-blanche-316624208aca4f30825c4b67f5836373.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Byredo</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This scent offers impressive longevity for such an airy and unobtrusive fragrance.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The fragrance smells dramatically different on hair, and not in an appealing way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of all the scents we tested, this one was the best for daytime — it smells like fresh sheets that were washed with a subtly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>floral and feminine</a> laundry detergent. It wears close to the skin and lasts for hours, making it very inoffensive and easy to wear, whether that’s at the office, to brunch, or running errands. It’s also one of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>best luxury perfumes</a> we tried, thanks to the heavy, sophisticated bottle, which is an aesthete’s dream (though may be harder to wield if you have smaller hands).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond testing it on skin, we tried spritzing the scent on fabric and hair.

For some reason, Blanche smells very sharp and overpowering on hair, a total contrast to how it wears on the skin. Keep this in mind if you’re the kind of person who likes to liberally spray on scent — concentrate your application on yourself and your clothing for the best result.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Aldehyde, peony, violet, sandalwood, musk｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Floral｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-men-escentric-molecules-molecule-01-eau-de-toilette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Escentric Molecules Molecule 01 Eau de Toilette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bloomingdale's Escentric Molecules Molecule 01 Eau de Toilette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Fg51bq1bF4ZbfjsxtWyowyiEcVI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/escentric-molecules-molecule-01-eau-de-toilette-dd51f228c82c4e6e947d7798b609874c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This single-note scent is very simple, yet wears differently on everyone.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Some people may be “nose blind” to it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The star of this scent is just one note: The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>woodsy iso e super</a>, a lab-made aroma which is somewhat reminiscent of sandalwood, giving this scent a subtly masculine quality without being heady or overpowering. To our surprise, it’s pretty delicate, and we needed to spray on multiple spritzes to detect its faint, clean smell. (We should note that this will deliver a blast of alcohol, which can be off-putting at first, but it quickly dissipates.) Its smell was strongest on heavy fabrics, like tweed, on which it smelled a bit musty, like a coat you recently pulled out of storage for the season.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the skin, it was fresh, clean, and sophisticated, and we felt like it would layer nicely with other perfumes in our scent wardrobe. We also think with regular wear, we’ll find the fragrance to be quite cozy and believe it to be a nice pick for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fall's cuffing season</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, while the scent seemed to last on our skin, it was often hard to detect during testing. This isn’t uncommon in skin scents — in fact, other people can often smell them on us when we can’t! —so if you’re looking for something subdued and a little mysterious, this is worth checking out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de toilette｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Iso e super (synthetic sandalwood)｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Woody｜<strong>Size</strong>: 3.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unisex-juliette-has-a-gun-not-a-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Unisex</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Juliette Has a Gun Not A Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Juliette Has a Gun Not A Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YWRXd3pJtw_1NW7O3dx_EUdoL48=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/juliette-has-a-gun-not-a-perfume-863c425287324dc5aa8b5396b5bf6f0d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This perfume completely evolves on the skin throughout the day, making it almost like multiple fragrances in one bottle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>This scent wears very, very differently depending on your unique body chemistry, so it’s best to test before buying.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the first spritz to hours after application, this perfume will take you on a journey. Two of us tried the scent and had totally different experiences. One of us found that it initially smelled a bit pungent, with a sour smell that almost reminded us of sweat before becoming more powdery and somewhat cardboard-like as well as masculine. Another found that it smelled plasticky and synthetic at first, then wore down into a floral, feminine, and musky aroma that sat close to the skin — earning us loads of compliments.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These differing experiences during the testing process were due to the single note in this scent, cetalox, which is a synthetic form of ambergris (aka whale vomit, which used to be used in perfume because of its unusual musky, sweet, earthy, and animalic qualities).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s imperative to try a fragrance like this firsthand to determine if it's a fit for you. Beyond that, we found it lingered well on skin, hair, and fabric (though it left an oily residue behind) and we enjoyed the wide-spraying mister and luxe, weighty packaging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Cetalox (synthetic ambergris)｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Warm and spicy｜<strong>Size</strong>: 3.3 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-to-bring-out-your-own-natural-scent-ds--durga-i-dont-know-what></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best to Bring Out Your Own Natural Scent</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>D.S. & Durga I Don't Know What</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="D.S. &amp;amp; Durga I Don't Know What" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/P_D7uNgjnipFutcJLfPJS_A5gcM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ds--durga-i-dont-know-what-7cc8eaada57548888e771ba17ea3fd65.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>D.S. & Durga</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This is an effortlessly wearable scent that just enhances your own body chemistry.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The bottle can be a little challenging to use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This D.S. & Durga perfume features some of the notes you’ll find in a lot of skin scents, like iso e super and ambrox, but there’s also bergamot and vetiver, which made us decide during the testing process that it can be worn by both men and women alike. It was fresh, clean, and musky, with a touch of greenery. It was one of the best lightweight scents we tried; we admit that it wasn’t always easy to detect on our skin (though others could!) but it was easy to smell on fabric, paper, and hair.

Though it’s very attractive and has a nice, luxurious heft, it had a short nozzle that wasn’t easy to mist and the bottle’s shape and size made it a challenge to hold and spray on — we actually needed two hands to do so. However, if you like the aroma, enjoy a minimalist design, and have slightly larger hands, you’ll probably be satisfied with this investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Eau de parfum｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Bergamot, iso e super (synthetic sandalwood), vetiver, civettone (a synthetic musk), ambroxan (synthetic ambergris — a woody amber)｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Amber｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sensual-diptyque-leau-papier-eau-de-toilette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sensual</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Diptyque L’eau Papier Eau de Toilette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Diptyque L&amp;acirc;eau Papier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iKUXjgBxh8aeJwPjwozlyvXlVPY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/diptyque-leau-papier-5195fa622ac44fcfb2dcbbd6e7b9c247.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Diptyque</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> What you smell out of the bottle is what you get — it smelled like this on two InStyle editors who tested it on their skin, and the scent remained completely intact all day.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It did leave a stain behind when we tested it on fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sensual without being sexy, impactful without being overpowering, and totally soothing, this was the best musk we tested.

Its warmth makes it well suited for winter wear, ideally if you can spritz it on before unwinding in front of a roaring fire.

This one arrives quickly and once you try it out, you’ll likely be impressed with your purchase — the oil-based formula lasted all day and night once we applied it (on both skin and hair) and was quite easy to apply due to its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rollerball format</a>. The essential oil-infused perfume is quite strong, especially at first, with a scent trail that’s possible to smell from two feet away. It features an unusual blend of fruity, floral, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>spicy notes</a> that ultimately wore down to a vanilla-y floral aroma over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though we enjoy the convenience of the rollerball bottle and its travel-friendly size, the packaging is not high-end by any means, with a simple printed label that we found to be a little cheesy.

We found it to be sweet, juicy, and fruity with something of a candy-like quality to it, making it a nice pick for daytime wear. It was quite strong at first (a little goes a long way; we only needed one or two passes of the rollerball), but it mellowed out nicely throughout the day. Even though it’s oil based, it didn’t stain any fabrics or leave behind greasy strands when we applied it to our hair, though it did leave a bit of residue on our skin after application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though we appreciate this formula, we think the packaging needs a significant upgrade. It looks pretty lowbrow, like it could have come out of a child’s makeup playset, with a cheap label that has an overly youthful colorway. What bugged us the most during testing is that it says “sex attractant” directly on the bottle, which is a feature of this pheromone fragrance that you may not want to advertise to others. Considering it’s travel-sized and designed to be taken on the go, we’d be wary of keeping it in our purse, lest it roll out and announce our intentions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Roll-on oil｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Not listed｜<strong>Fragrance Family:</strong> Sweet fruity floral｜<strong>Size</strong>: .34 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-lasting-rawchemistry-delight-pheromone-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Lasting</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RawChemistry Delight Pheromone Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RawChemistry Delight Pheromone Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iIrgrcnZYlFDxgY9rNRg1vhOfEQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/RawChemistry-Delight-Pheromone-Perfume-92ac72431f2b4d6d8f26f44a5c2901e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>RawChemistry</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Scent</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Packaging</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is a nicely balanced scent with an interesting and appealing blend of notes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It leaves an oily residue behind.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We didn’t know what to expect from this purple-packaged fragrance, but we were very pleasantly surprised. The scent features floral, fresh, fruity, and spicy notes that makes for a very unique perfume. While you might think such a broad-ranging blend of notes wouldn’t work, it’s very easy and enjoyable to wear: It evolves from a sweet floral you can wear during spring or summer to a warm apple-cinnamon-like fragrance that would be great for fall or winter. You only need one spritz to get plenty of coverage, and that initial spray will last the entire day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will say that we didn’t expect this eau de toilette to have any oil in it, which became apparent both when we tested it on fabric and on our skin.

The scent had significant staying power, likely because of its jojoba oil base, which left a slight film on our skin and hair (though just left it feeling moisturized, not greasy). It did admittedly stain the fabrics we tested it on, so we’d recommend focusing your application on skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the perfume is spicy, that quality fades away to let the white florals shine, which makes this a wearable scent for all seasons. The aroma is very strong, which we didn’t mind as we loved it, but keep that in mind if you don’t like a fragrance that projects — we were able to smell this one from over five feet away.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside is its packaging. Though the bottle looks like it might have a rollerball or a mini atomizer, it actually only has a stopper, so once you unscrew the cap, you’ll have to carefully dab on the perfume. We found this highly dissatisfying and during testing, we spilled out too much several times. We wouldn’t trust the integrity of the packaging for traveling — the probability of dousing everything in our bag with perfume is way too high.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Perfume oil｜<strong>Key Notes: </strong>Coffee, pepper, orange blossom, jasmine｜<strong>Fragrance Family: </strong>Fresh floral｜<strong>Size</strong>: 1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once we narrowed down our selection of pheromone perfumes to 17 different options, we shipped them off to our team of InStyle editors, who assessed the fragrances on five different categories: scent, wear, performance, efficacy, and packaging. Each scent was tested by two different InStyle editors to analyze how the perfumes interacted with different body chemistries. In addition to sampling the fragrances on their skin, we tried them on several types of fabric (including silk and spandex), paper, and hair extensions to determine how the scent evolved or if it left residue behind after application. After collecting and analyzing our editors’ feedback and wrote about their positive and negative experiences of each formula, including more specific details from their perfume trials, as well as interviewed three fragrance experts to get their insights on pheromone perfumes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fragrance Notes</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some pheromone perfumes will actually contain synthetic versions of the real thing. “Pheromones are chemical signals that humans release that can relate to mating and fostering social bonds,” explains Ashlee Posner, founder of transparent fragrance manufacturer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Lucent Laboratories</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">State of Change</a>. “You won’t be able to smell those ingredients, at least in a traditional way — they’re sensed.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Unlike other perfumes, pheromones are not perceived by the olfactory glands of the nose, but by what is called the Jacobson's organ,” says Ben Krigler, the fifth-generation perfumer of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">House of Krigler</a>. This organ is located in the base of the nasal cavity. When it’s triggered by a pheromone, it sends a signal to your brain to stimulate your pleasure centers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, you’ll be able to smell other notes used in perfumes designed to enhance your attraction. Some are subtler than others. For example, one of the most common types of perfumes in this category are “skin scents,” which are designed to make you smell like you, but better. In these formulas, “the notes that you can expect are warm and alluring, meant to be smelled close to the body,” says Meg Gray, Director of Merchandising at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bluemercury</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Notes that fall into this category include iso e super and musk, which you’ll find in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">D.S. & Durga I Don't Know What Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Escentric Molecules Molecule 01 Eau de Toilette</a>. “Skin scents can end up smelling woody, powdery, or like fresh linen,” she adds. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Byredo Blanche Eau de Parfum</a> is a good example of this.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are also more noticeable scents known for smelling especially alluring. Krigler recommends warm, sensual aromas, like patchouli, caramel, rose, and fruity and sugary notes. You can also look to animalic notes like tuberose or cetalox (the latter of which is inspired by ambergris). You’ll find these in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Frédéric Malle Carnal Flower by Dominique Ropion</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Juliette Has A Gun Not A Perfume Eau de Parfum</a> respectively. “Animalic” is just a more discreet way of saying it smells like sex, sweat, or other “dirty” aromas.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Longevity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for any perfume, longevity is the name of the game — you don’t want to apply a fragrance in the morning, only for it to dissipate by lunch. That’s especially true if you’re trying to make yourself magnetic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One way to boost your wear time is to start with a perfume rather than eau de toilette, as the former is made with a stronger concentration of scent and will last longer. If you can find an extrait de parfum, go for it: “It has the highest concentration of fragrance at 20 to 30 percent, which can last for 12+ hours,” says Gray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Application makes a difference, too. “Apply to moisturized skin and to pulse points or anywhere warm on your body,” says Posner, who also recommends storing your perfume out of direct sunlight and heat, which will limit degradation, preserving the lifespan and performance of your fragrance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind, though, that if you hold on to the same bottle for years, you may not like it as you get older. “Your chemistry evolves with age,” explains Krigler. “You won’t react the same way to a perfume if you are 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 — it's normal and part of life.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Expectations</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t expect a bottle of perfume to transform you from a wallflower to a sexual dynamo with one spritz! “A European researcher told me that so-called human pheromones sold commercially have no scientific basis,” points out Krigler.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But a good perfume can and will go a long way towards making you feel your best — which will inherently help boost your charm. “It makes you feel more confident, more interesting…if you feel sexy, another person will be attracted to your confidence,” Krigler adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is pheromone perfume?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, pheromone perfume is a fragrance designed to amplify your sex appeal. In some cases, they may contain synthetic human pheromones, says Posner. “Scientific evidence supporting this in humans is limited.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Krigler, these pheromones will differ between scents designed for men and women. “Pheromone perfumes for women generally contain the pheromones androstenol, androstadienone and other copulins, which stimulate desire and romantic passion,” he says. “Pheromone perfumes for men generally consist of androstenone and androsterone, which combine to evoke strength and sexual attraction.” You’ll find synthetic pheromones in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pure Romance Basic Instinct Pheromone Perfume</a>, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pure Instinct Pheromone Perfume (Roll-On)</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Venom Scents Original Scent</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, not all pheromone perfumes are formulated with pheromones. In many cases, “a pheromone perfume is a scent that mixes with your naturally-occurring pheromones and body chemistry,” says Gray. These might be referred to as “skin scents,” or they could just be especially sexy fragrances that will make you stand out.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do pheromone perfumes work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maybe — the jury’s still out, at least on the fragrances designed with faux pheromones. “Pheromone perfumes are an attempt to synthetically recreate these signals, which at this point is not scientifically proven,” explains Posner. “With that being said, science is amazing, so who knows what the future and biotechnology hold.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we do know that perfume overall can make you smell sexier to others; it’s just the matter of picking the right scent. “Certain people are attracted to specific scents, so if someone is already attracted to your skin scent, these fragrances will only enhance that attraction,” says Gray.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And anecdotally, it’s worth a try: “I have a client who literally told me that when she smells a pheromone perfume, she has a small orgasm,” Krigler reveals. We’ll have what she’s having!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does pheromone scent smell like?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No pheromone scent smells the same.

Pregnancy is of course a beautiful chapter in her life but it is also a phase of drastic physical changes. In this period, more than 90% of women encounter complex and significant skin changes that have a huge impact on their life (<a href=#><u>1</u></a>). So, to all those lovely moms-to-be, we have created a list of the best pregnancy-safe face moisturizers to help them enhance their pregnancy glow and the quality of their skin. Our list contains varied moisturizers that are nothing less than saviors. Believe us, they will keep your skin youthful, healthy, soft, smooth, and primarily hydrated, just like you always wished for.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we begin with the shopping haul, here is something that you need to know — when a woman conceives, the maternal immune response is extensively altered to help the fetus get attached to the mother. This leads to immunological changes during pregnancy. Secondly, hyperpigmentation is also the most common skincare woe that results due to elevated serum levels of progesterone or estrogen (<a href=#><u>1</u></a>). On the other hand, physiological changes lead to worsening or development of acne vulgaris (<a href=#><u>2</u></a>). Now, after taking note of these three main changes, you must have understood the importance of relying on a pregnancy-safe daily moisturizer. Thus, today, we focus on such moisturizers that won’t cause any effect on your skin while you are developing a baby within.&nbsp;</p><p>Below is our comprehensive list of some top-notch moisturizers safe for pregnancy.

These ingredients work toward enhancing, rejuvenating, nourishing, and hydrating your skin to the maximum.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>: The best facial moisturizer for pregnancy is one that is non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, non-toxic, dermatologically-tested, and free from harmful chemicals. Make sure you stay away from creams that are formulated with parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances. You may also pick a good-quality pregnancy-safe face moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30 for everyday use. It will help you protect your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays of the sun and quench the thirst of your dehydrated skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Texture</strong>: The moisturizer should be light in weight and possess a non-greasy, and non-sticky texture.

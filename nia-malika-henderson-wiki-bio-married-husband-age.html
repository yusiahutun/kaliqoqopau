She covers politics, politics, and people who shape Washington for the American television channel.</p><p>If you don’t know her from her reports for the CNN platforms, you must have noticed her in the network’s “Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” or “CNN Tonight with Don Lemon”, where she regularly appears as a panel member of CNN’s discussion programs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Nia-Malika Henderson Wiki/Bio/Age</strong></h2><p>Nia-Malika Henderson celebrated her birthday on the 7th of this month (July). According to records, she was born in 1974.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Nia-Malika-Henderson-640x353.jpg><p>In 1992 she graduated from Lower Richland High School in Hopkins, South Carolina. Henderson graduated from Duke University with a bachelor’s degree in literature and cultural anthropology. She continued her studies with a master’s degree in American Studies from Yale University. She then earned a master’s degree in journalism. This time from Columbia University.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kate Fagan ESPN, Partner, Body Measurements, Husband Wiki, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Nia-Malika Henderson CNN/Career</strong></h2><p>Before Nia-Malika Henderson joined CNN in 2015, she was a national political reporter for the Washington Post. She established herself as a guru in political reporting, reporting on the White House, the 2012 presidential election campaign, the 2010 midterm elections, and the Post’s Election 2012 blog.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Nia-Malika-Henderson-Wiki.jpg><p>Henderson’s resume wouldn’t be enough if he didn’t point out that she spent the first two years of Barack Obama’s government on Politico. Apart from that, she’s also highly regarded for being the New Day’s leading reporter on Obama’s 2008 campaign, the Democratic Primary, and the Democratic National Conference.</p><p>But these were not the works that brought her closer to the Pulitzer Prize in 2005. It was a series about the history of hip-hop, and Nia-Malika Henderson was a member of the Newsday team that was eligible as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory reporting.</p><p>But before New Year, The Baltimore Sun existed for Nia Malika. She worked as an author for the media house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Nia-Malika-Henderson-Bio.jpg><p>Henderson did not join the Cable News Network until 2015. Nonetheless, the network has granted her credit and recognized her coverage of the 2016 elections, the transition to president, the government of President Donald Trump and the Democratic Party.</p><p>CNN also recognizes her for her report during the 2016 election season. It actively covered the Democratic and Republican candidates.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> CNN is particularly pleased</a> with the way she covered “Bernie Sanders’ insurgent campaign, Ben Carson’s unlikely offer, and Donald Trump’s Republican Party reorientation”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married/ Husband</strong></h2><p>Much is not known about the private life of Nia-Malika Henderson. It is obvious that she has perfectly guarded the information her fans want to know about her outside public space, while she has worked hard to tell stories about political events and make them easily accessible for consumption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nia-Malika-Henderson-2.jpg><p>Apart from information about her career, which is abundant, the details about where Nia-Malika Henderson grew up, her parents, and siblings are hard to find. This also applies to information about her love life. All speculation and rumors have been left to their discretion.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Victor Webster’s Wife, Married, Gay, Girlfriend, Height</a></strong></p><p>Not long past, it began to circulate that Nia-Malika Henderson is together with Glenn Beck. Beck is also a media personality. He is known as the television and radio presenter who founded Mercury Radio Arts. In 2002, he created the media platform as the parent company of various types of media.</p><p>The story that Glenn Beck is the secret husband of Nia-Malika Henderson has no substance. The CEO, owner, and founder of Mercury Radio Arts met his first wife, Claire, several years before 1983. Beck and Claire later married and had two daughters, Mary and Hannah. However, the couple divorced in 1994 because Beck was struggling with drugs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nia-Malika-Henderson-1.jpg><p>Five years later, in 1999, Beck married his second wife, Tania. It is known that Beck and his current wife Tania are parents of two children – Raphe and Cheyenne – and lived with all of Beck’s children.</p><p>Nia-Malika Henderson was supposed to have secretly dated Beck when he hosted a nightly news commentary show for CNN. But that was between 2006 and 2008 when Henderson was still far from being near CNN.</p><p>With the above in mind, it is safe to say, if not correct, that Nia-Malika Henderson has never been married to anyone. When she meets someone, she has the public the information</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ku6qtjKaYpaGblnqpsc2dnKurn6N6uLXKomSboZ9iuqK%2B0aKcnWWYqsCjrc2dZJqflWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnia-malika-henderson-wiki-bio-married-husband-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnia-malika-henderson-wiki-bio-married-husband-age.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnia-malika-henderson-wiki-bio-married-husband-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnia-malika-henderson-wiki-bio-married-husband-age.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnia-malika-henderson-wiki-bio-married-husband-age.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnia-malika-henderson-wiki-bio-married-husband-age.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-loreal-skincare-products-1216417.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-loreal-skincare-products-1216417.html>13 Best LOreal Skincare Products That You Just Cant Miss!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nia-long-and-peter-thomas.html>Nia Long and Peter Thomas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nia-long-and-peter-thomas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

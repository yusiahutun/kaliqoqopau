There’s a remarkable array of quality highs and lows in its five-year run, but when this story of small town life and sports-centric communities was at its best, it was very, very good. Progressive in the way it handled the lives of young people without talking down to them, it feels like a re-appreciation of Friday Night Lights as one of network TV’s best modern shows is right around the corner.</p>Friday Night Lights <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clfr9cdth00ix3b6ssj8zrxa1@published>Hannibal</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfr9cdpj00iv3b6sup8xujy3@published data-word-count=8><strong>Years: </strong>2013-2015<br><strong>Length: </strong>3 seasons, 39 episodes<br><strong>Creator: </strong>Bryan Fuller</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfr9zg8o00ng3b6supdwvep5@published data-word-count=93>It’s hard to believe this was ever on television.

While everyone has a different definition of what a “hookup” means, there’s only one answer to this question.</p><p>Austen Kroll and Taylor Ann Green are two cast members on Season 9 of Southern Charm, Bravo’s reality <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> series following the personal and professional lives of socialites in Charleston, South Carolina. Austen joined Southern Charm in Season 4, while Taylor joined in Season 7.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Austen and Taylor were involved in a scandal in Southern Charm Season 9 when Austen revealed that they had kissed off camera between Seasons 8 and 9. The kiss came after Taylor’s breakup with her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Southern Charm co-star</a> and ex-boyfriend, Shep Rose. The hookup also came amid Austen’s romance with his ex and Taylor’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>best friend, Olivia Flowers</a>. In an episode of Southern Charm Season 9, Olivia questioned the timeline of Austen and Taylor’s hookup, speculating that it happened while Austen and Olivia were still together. “During this time that she’s saying that they had a conversation, I was in California for three days,” Olivia said in a confessional interview. “And the entire time I was gone, Austen was reaching out to me and telling me to give him another chance. And Taylor was a huge reason why I chose to forgive him. And a week later, he suddenly has a change of heart.”</p><p>While Austen and Taylor maintain that they just shared a kiss, their cast believes that something more happened. So did <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/austen-taylor-dating-southern-charm/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Austen and Taylor hook up from Southern Charm</a>? Read on for what we know about Austen and Taylor hookup rumors and whether there’s any truth to them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=did-austen-and-taylor-hook-up-from-southern-charm>Did Austen and Taylor hook up from Southern Charm?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Southern-Charm-Cast-Season-9.jpg><p>Did Austen and Taylor hook up from Southern Charm? The answer is no. A production source confirmed to People in March 2023 that <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/tv/southern-charm-austen-kroll-taylor-ann-green-thought-about-dating-after-they-made-out-source/ rel=nofollow>Austen and Taylor kissed</a> in the fall of 2022 after filming ended on Southern Charm Season 8 but did not sleep either each other. “They didn’t have sex, just made out,” the insider said.</p><p>The source also claimed that Austen and Taylor considered dating after their kiss but decided not to because of Taylor’s friendship with Austen’s ex-girlfriend and their Southern Charm co-star, Olivia Flowers. “They thought about dating and took time to think about [it] for a quick sec, talked to their family about it,” the insider said. “But at the end of the day, Taylor said it wasn’t worth losing Olivia’s friendship if her and Austen didn’t work and she was at a low point after [the] reunion.”</p><p>Both Austen and Taylor also denied that they hooked up throughout Southern Charm Season 9. “Swear on my life,” Taylor told Olivia in an episode. Austen and Taylor’s Southern Charm co-star (and Austen’s ex-girlfriend), Madison LeCroy, however, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/madison-lecroy-wants-truth-about-austen-taylor-hookup/>doesn’t believe they didn’t hook u</a><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/madison-lecroy-wants-truth-about-austen-taylor-hookup/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">p</a>. “I don’t know if we’ll ever find out the truth,” she told Us Weekly in September 2023. I still have questions.”</p><p>Taylor addressed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.tvinsider.com/1109472/southern-charm-taylor-ann-green/>Madison believing that she and Austen hooked up</a> in an interview with TV Insider in October 2023. “It’s very frustrating, but part of our job to be intertwined and interconnected. Everyone has to be in everyone’s business,” she said. “The frustrating thing was when all that transpired, the only people that were involved were me, Austen, and then Olivia and Shep. The fact that other people are weighing in, it’s not their business. It has nothing to do with them. Why are you trying to get up in this business and create more drama out of it? How do you know anything when I haven’t seen or talked to you? You don’t know the real story.”</p><p>She continued, “So, making allegations we slept together. I don’t even think Madison has been to his house. The fact she is saying he doesn’t have a bed in his guest bedroom. He has two guest bedrooms and there are two beds in the guest bedroom. She doesn’t know that. Making allegations when she is not completely involved is very frustrating.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-taylor-from-southern-charm-now>Where is Taylor from Southern Charm now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Southern-Charm.jpg><p>Where is Taylor from Southern Charm now? Taylor asked for “mercy” from Bravo fans in an interview with Entertainment Tonight in September 2023 while discussing her <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/southern-charms-taylor-ann-green-explains-austen-kroll-hookup-and-its-season-9-aftermath-exclusive>kiss with Austen</a>. “All I can say is, please be easy on me,” she said. “Have some grace and mercy.” She continued, “It’s going to be really tough, it really is. Everybody makes mistakes. I feel like Hannah Montana, but seriously: we’re human. I’m not perfect. I think that after the breakup, I was just a very broken and hurt person and hurt people hurt people, so there’s a lot of that going on.”</p><p>Taylor also admitted what she did wrong in her drama with Austen and Olivia on Southern Charm Season 9. “There is just a multitude of different situations, how I handled things, how I handled myself,” she said. “I&nbsp;mean, I felt like I was reliving reunion all over again, where I would just black out and I would go, ‘What did I do? What did I say? Why did I say that?'”</p><p>As for why she and Austen kissed, Taylor explained to Entertainment Tonight that she was in a state of vulnerability after her breakup with her Southern Charm co-star and ex-boyfriend, Shep Rose. “You know, it was just a moment of feeling comfortable, vulnerable and a sense of love that you maybe got confused with, because you are so close to this person,” she said. “I always love and respect and have an adoration for Austen but, no, no love interest.”</p><p>In her interview with Entertainment Tonight, Taylor also swore on her life that she and Austen did not hook up. “You know, people say, ‘What does the term ‘hookup’ mean?'” she said. “When I say, ‘I swear on my life, I didn’t hook up with Austen,’ in my definition, I didn’t.”</p><p>In response to her co-stars accusing her of telling “lies,” Taylor told the site, “I would absolutely handle things differently. I had so many up-and-down moments of just wanting to lay everything out on the table and come clean about all of it, but I held back because I was trying to protect, I guess, myself and Austen and the situation, knowing that what was at hand wasn’t anything. So, I didn’t feel the need to, like, expand upon everything, but as the rumor mill kept turning, I was like, ‘I think that we need to lay it all out there’ … but Austen beat me to the punch.”</p><p>At the end, Taylor explained that what affected her the most from her drama on Southern Charm Season 9 was her fallout with her former best friend, Olivia. “If you test somebody’s trust or friendship’s trust– I’m such a forgiving person, where I go, ‘If this happened one time I can forgive and forget, let’s move forward,'” she said. “And I think that’s what Olivia and I have going on here. So, that doorway is still open — it’s not shut forever — and I can only hope that we’ll continue to throw it wide, back open at some point, but we’ll just have to revisit that some other time.”</p><p>She continued, “We have this special bond, getting to know her when she moved to Charleston was really sweet and special, especially having the four of us, myself, Shep, she and Austen, all hanging out. It was really special, so I hope to rebuild that to some extent. I don’t know if it will ever be the same. I know that I can get there, but it’s just kinda surface right now, or tabled, and will resurface at reunion.”</p><p>Taylor also reacted to death of her brother, Worth, in June 2023, just four months after the death of Olivia’s brother, Conner. “It’s wild to even think about that all happening after I just experienced it with Olivia,” Taylor told Entertainment Tonight. “And having never lost a person who is super, super close to me, so of course Olivia has been incredible in reaching out to me and, you know, on that level of our friendship where it’s, like, this weird, horrible club to be a part of, but there we are, we’re together in it.”</p><p>She continued, “You will get to see a little bit of my brother [on the season] and just know that he is, like, the most awesome, fun-loving, easygoing, caring human being and I’m excited that people get to see that, experience that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=did-taylor-send-whitney-a-nude-photo-from-southern-charm>Did Taylor send Whitney a nude photo from Southern Charm?</h2><p>Did Taylor send Whitney a nude photo from Southern Charm? Another storyline she was involved with on Southern Charm Season 9 was when Taylor was accused of sending her co-star Whitney Sudler-Smith a nude photograph. Taylor confirmed she did send the naked picture in her interview with Entertainment Tonight. “It was a very drunken night, I knew what Shep and Whitney had been up to the past few months, galavanting around Charleston, trying to pick up girls and so, I did that to get under Shep’s skin,” she said. “And that was very childish of me.”</p><p>She continued, “I am owning it. I’m not proud, but it was definitely a jab.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-taylor-and-shep-back-together-from-southern-charm>Are Taylor and Shep back together from Southern Charm?</h2><p>Are Taylor and Shep back together from Southern Charm? Taylor confirmed that she and Shep are back together and are still broken up in her interview with Entertainment Tonight. “We have not dipped into any kind of relationship,” she said. “You’ll see what happens, but there’s just a level of comfortability I think that everybody kinda goes through that little aspect after a breakup… it felt right, I knew it was wrong, but it was comfortable, it was easy.”</p><p>She also confirmed that she’s not dating her new co-star, Jarrett “JT” Thomas. “He is just, like, this really fun, funny, easygoing guy that will have you peeling over in laughter,” Taylor said. “I’m the type of person that, I love to laugh, so anytime that JT’s around, I know that it’s gonna be a good time and good laughter. Does he want to fight everybody? Both, probably true, he does. We’ve even got into our arguments and had our disagreements, but yeah, you’ll kind of see our friendship unfold. It’s a definite friendship.”</p><p>She continued, “The conversation that JT and I have had is, we are friends and that is where we want to be,” she continues, “and like, I love and enjoy you, and I enjoy your company, and I know you feel the same way, but what I do does not concern you. So if you are going to continue to bring things up, you got to stop.”</p><p>Southern Charm airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

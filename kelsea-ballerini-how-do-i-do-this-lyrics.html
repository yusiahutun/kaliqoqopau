All those jitters before a first date? Well, even one of the most successful country singers in the world has them too.</p><p>Kelsea went through a highly publicized divorce with fellow country singer Morgan Evans. She moved on quickly with her own wit and decided to shoot her shot and hasn’t looked back. In an interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast in February 2023, Ballerini revealed that she and Stokes met after she direct messaged him on Instagram.</p><p>“I slid into those DMs,” Kelsea said, adding that she was “not going to get on an app” to meet someone.&nbsp;“He shoots [Outer Banks] in Charleston, and my manager lives there. … He was like, ‘You know who’s really cute, like, when you’re ready? Chase.’ I was like, ‘You’re so right.’”&nbsp;She continued, “I’ve never seen his show, but I just knew of him, and I just swan dove right on in,” Ballerini said. When asked what her first message was to Stokes, Ballerini said, “His handle is ‘@hichasestokes,’ and I said, ‘Hi, Chase Stokes.’”</p><p>She continued, “I think I’m finally an adult. I think that just happened over the last couple of years, and I feel like what that means to me is I have opinions. I have a career that is a priority for me, to show up for myself and the people that I’ve aligned with along this journey. And I have aspirations and goals that are tied to no one, and those are all really important things.”</p><p>As for if she’s happy with her new boo, she told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1613530/kelsea-ballerini/>StyleCaster</a> that’s she’s not afraid of it being in the public sphere. “The thing that we’ve decided, and to each their own, is when you’re with someone that you feel secure with and that you’re proud to be with, why not share it?” she says. “<a href=#>He’s also a Virgo</a>; we’re both Labrador Retrievers in human form. It doesn’t take much conversation to be on the same page. It’s been half a year and it’s been great.”</p><p>She also said she’s not afraid to move on in her Call Her Daddy appearance.&nbsp;“I’m not married to him anymore,” she said. “I don’t need to care about his feelings anymore. And I mean that with all the respect in the world, but his journey is not mine anymore. I hope he is protected from whatever he needs to be protected from seeing — I hope he has people in his life that help him do that — [but] that is not my job.”</p><p>She also told the podcast about how she was “relearning” how to be in a relationship after her divorce. “I’m really relearning a lot about myself and how I show up in a relationship and how I show up for myself,” she said. “And it’s been a really beautiful reawakening.”</p><p>When releasing her new EP, she warned her fans not to contact her ex. “with this, comes a favor. from the deepest and purest part of my heart, i ask that you help this be ours and let the music simply be the music, not dig back into the experience that it was written about nearly a year ago. as a songwriter, producer, artist i’m proud and protective of this EP, and as a woman and human also proud and protective of the new, happy season of life i’m in.”</p><p>She continued, “my real hope is for us to continue growing, healing, and evolving together with acceptance and kindness (even when we unleash our inner fire breathing dragon singing the new versions of these songs). am i right? 😉”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfoLKtv8SaZJuZnKGys7XNomShp6disbB5yGabqGWknba0ecuyqaKbo2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkelsea-ballerini-how-do-i-do-this-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkelsea-ballerini-how-do-i-do-this-lyrics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkelsea-ballerini-how-do-i-do-this-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkelsea-ballerini-how-do-i-do-this-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkelsea-ballerini-how-do-i-do-this-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkelsea-ballerini-how-do-i-do-this-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./toasted-coconut-shortbread.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./toasted-coconut-shortbread.html>toasted coconut shortbread</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./e-40-real-name-family-height-html.html>E-40 Wife, Real Name, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./e-40-real-name-family-height-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
